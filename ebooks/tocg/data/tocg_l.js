2) Over 800000 people in the US are estimated to have tried skiing. This may seem a large number but it represents just over 0,26% of the total population of 300 million. So, per capita, it is surprisingly small.<br>\
3) It's estimated that India is home to between 38000 and<br>\
53000 wild elephants, while Africa has between 470000 and 690000. Exact figures are difficult to determine. <br>\
4) An elephant can weigh between 2,5 and 5 tonnes. This is comparable to the tongue of the blue whale, which alone can weigh 2,7 tonnes. In fact, a blue whale can weigh 15 times more than an elephant, and can grow to about 10 times the size of a standard bus."

A: Oh, that's fine, I usually organise a coach ticket for my customers, because a taxi is far too expensive. But a lift from a local is even better. What about skiing equipment? <br>\

B: That's right. I moved there once I'd graduated and worked for five years before coming back to England in January. <br>\
A: Right. And you've worked briefly in accounts but in sales, mostly... Is that the area you are still interested in working in? We have a very strong sales department. <br>\

B: Well, I did a huge assignment on water pollution last year so we could just do that?<br>\
A: Actually, the tutor did make a point of saying not to use last year's materials. So we'd better not.<br>\
B: It's probably a bit out of date now anyway. Also, it focused specifically on industry and I think we're supposed to take a broad view.<br>\
A: That's right. We could look at something totally different, like the effects of fumes on air quality.<br>\
B: Hmm, good idea. And we could make sure we include all of the sources, like traffic and factories.<br>\
A: So, what else do we need to do? Shall we go to the library and look for resources?<br>\
B: Actually, I think we'd be better off looking online. The good resources in the library are often all out at this time of the year. Anyway, before we notify the tutor which topic we've chosen, I think we need to ask the others what they're doing.<br>\
A: You're right. We need to make sure we're not all doing the same thing. Let's ask them this afternoon in the tutorial.<br>\

A: Đúng rồi. Bạn có sở thích nào không?<br>\
B: À, năm ngoái mình đã làm một bài tập lớn về ô nhiễm nước nên chúng ta có thể làm vậy thôi?<br>\
A: Thực ra, giáo viên hướng dẫn đã nói rõ là không nên sử dụng tài liệu của năm ngoái. Vậy nên tốt hơn là chúng ta không nên.<br>\
B: Dù sao thì bây giờ có lẽ nó hơi lỗi thời rồi. Ngoài ra, nó tập trung cụ thể vào ngành công nghiệp và tôi nghĩ chúng ta nên có cái nhìn tổng quát.<br>\
A: Đúng rồi. Chúng ta có thể xem xét một thứ hoàn toàn khác, như tác động của khói bụi lên chất lượng không khí.<br>\
B: Ồ, ý tưởng hay đấy. Và chúng ta có thể đảm bảo rằng mình bao gồm tất cả các nguồn, như giao thông và nhà máy.<br>\
A: Vậy, chúng ta cần làm gì nữa? Chúng ta sẽ đến thư viện và tìm tài liệu chứ?<br>\
B: Thực ra, tôi nghĩ chúng ta nên tìm kiếm trực tuyến. Các nguồn tài liệu hay trong thư viện thường hết vào thời điểm này trong năm. Dù sao thì, trước khi thông báo cho giáo viên về chủ đề chúng ta đã chọn, tôi nghĩ chúng ta cần hỏi những người khác xem họ đang làm gì.<br>\

We encountered quite a few problems during our research. Firstly, the weather was horrendous and made our work conditions very difficult indeed. Luckily, we had the right equipment to deal with that, and could carry on regardless. Unfortunately though, in spite of having so many volunteers, we did run out of funds halfway through the project. So, we were forced to postpone the second half of our trip."

I just wanted to tell you about some of the recent changes we've made to the garden at the back of the complex, which we all have access to. As you know, there are some attractive and well-established plants in there and we didn't want to take any of these out. But many of these are struggling in the harsh sun, which falls directly on that area. To solve this we're going to plant trees along the western edge of the garden, just near the pond. This should also become a very pleasant place to sit and watch the ducks in the water.<br>\

Studying ice cores in the South Pole can tell us a lot about the past climate, which, in turn, can help us understand how today's climate is changing. My particular area of study is snow. While we scientists understand the process of how snow is created, very little is known about how snow interacts with the atmosphere and influences our weather patterns. One of the things we're trying to do is to link what we already know about meteorology and clouds and determine the impact that snow has on that."

It has some amazing features. The first thing you notice is how much slimmer and lighter it is compared to the heavier older models. It's incredible considering that they have actually increased the screen size on this one, though it still fits neatly into your pocket. They've also improved the camera and you'll find you can take much better quality photos on this model. This has an impact on the battery though, as it takes a lot of power and I found it didn't run for very long before needing to be recharged. Despite all its amazing features, it's extremely easy to use, but I do have to say that it is overpriced, and will be beyond the budget of most people shopping for a new phone."

The Traviston Frog is different to many other species of frog. It is very small and so, unlike other species, it is unable to live in the area of a pond, though it does need to live in fairly close proximity to water so that it can feed. Rather than choosing the safety of a tree, which would be too tall and may actually increase the threat from predators, it elects to live in a tiny burrow surrounded by bushes."

So, I just wanted to give you a briefing about what you can find where. The information booth is to the right of the entrance and I've given you all a plan to mark important places on. One of the most common enquiries is where can I pay for my parking? People are amazed when we tell them that it's free now. We used to charge for it and there was a ticket booth to the left of the entrance, but now that it's been turned into a small stage, we hold cookery demonstrations there. Local chefs come in and show people how to prepare dishes. It's really popular and you get a nice view of the fountain there. We have over 50 stalls at the markets, selling everything from fresh fruit and vegetables to locally made crafts. Which unfortunately means people won't find things like books or anything second-hand. We have a famous baker at the market and many people get here really early just to buy his produce. His stall is located at the back of the markets next to the barbecue. We sell burgers and sausages there but a lot of people like to bring their own lunch to eat and they're welcome to go to the special area near the tree in the middle of the markets where they can do just that. It's handy for the toilets too. The markets are located next to a circus school that holds classes for children at the weekend, so we often get a lot of family groups in. There's a playground on the right-hand side that's popular with them, and just in front of that is where the farmers bring along chickens, rabbits and lambs for the children to pet. That's always a very popular feature so you'll definitely be asked about that. Just let people know there is a small fee if the children want to feed them. Well, that's everything for now..."

A: Do you know where the park is?<br>\

A: Well there's a circular track that goes right around the park. The run starts at the café, goes past the tennis courts then twice around the lake and finishes back where it started.<br>\
B: OK and what time is the run?<br>\
A: Well the actual run begins at 9 am but the runners start arriving at about 8,45.<br>\
B: OK so I need to get up early Saturday morning then. And how long is the run?<br>\
A: Well it used to be three kilometres but most people wanted to do a bit more than that so we lengthened it to five kilometres - we now go round the lake twice and that adds an extra two kilometres.<br>\
B: Right not sure I've ever run that far so I'd better start doing a bit of training.<br>\
A: That's a good idea. But it's not a race, it's really just for fun and the best thing would be to take it easy the first few times you do it and then see if you can gradually improve your time.<br>\
B: Is the run timed then? How do I know how well I've done?<br>\
A: When you cross the finish line you'll be given a bar code and you take this to one of the run volunteers, who will scan it. Then you can get your time online when you go home.<br>\

A: Vâng - đợi một lát. Nó ở đâu đó ở đây - để tôi tìm xem. À, tôi có hai số của anh ấy. Tôi nghĩ cái bắt đầu bằng 0-1-2-7-3 là cái cũ rồi nên dùng cái này: 0-1-4- double 4-7-3-2-2-double zero.<br>\
B: OK - hiểu rồi. Bạn có thể cho tôi biết đôi điều về hoạt động tình nguyện không? Ví dụ như hoạt động này bao gồm những gì?<br>\
A: Chắc chắn rồi, chúng tôi cần tình nguyện viên cho những việc cơ bản như thiết lập đường đua. Chúng tôi phải làm điều đó trước khi tất cả người chạy đến.<br>\
B: OK - vậy là bắt đầu sớm thật!<br>\
A: Đúng rồi. Nhưng nếu bạn của bạn muốn đến muộn hơn một chút, cô ấy cũng có thể giúp hướng dẫn người chạy để họ không đi sai đường.<br>\
B: Tôi hiểu rồi. Tôi tin là bạn có báo cáo về một số cuộc đua.<br>\

One of the best ways of getting to know the town is to take the bus tour, which provides a wonderful viewing experience from one of our open-top buses. The tour is a round-trip of the town and there are a total of 4 stops where passengers can get on and off the bus. A lot of people start at the first stop which is at the train station as this is where many tourists arrive in the town. The next stop after the station is the aquarium which is famous for its dolphin show and which has recently expanded to include sharks. This is well worth a visit and is very reasonably priced. Leaving the aquarium, the bus tour goes along the coast road and after a few kilometres comes to the Old Fishing Village where you can get off to stroll along the waterfront. There are some original buildings here but most of the area has been modernised and is now used as a harbour for all kinds of sea craft including yachts and some amazing power boats. The tour then heads off to the last stop and this is where most of the shops are. So for those of you keen to do a bit of shopping this is the place for you. Our advice is to go to this part of the town in the morning when it is relatively quiet. It does get very busy in the afternoons, especially at the height of the season. This area of the town includes an ancient water fountain where many people like to have their photograph taken - so do look out for this.<br>\

Now some details of the costs and timings. A family ticket, which includes two adults and up to three children, costs £30. An adult ticket costs £15, children under the age of fifteen are £5 and student tickets are £10 as long as you have a student card. All tickets are valid for 24 hours, which means that you can get on and off the bus as many times as you like within a 24-hour period. So you could, for example, start the tour in the afternoon and complete it the following morning. The first bus of the day leaves the station at 10 am and the last one of the day leaves at 6 pm. Buses leave every thirty minutes and each tour takes a total of fifty minutes. There are many attractions at each of the stops, so wherever you get off the bus there will be plenty to do. The bus tour tickets do not include entrance to any of these attractions apart from the museum which is located near the aquarium. Some buses have local guides, who will point out places of interest and will provide information on the town. However, we cannot guarantee that every bus will have a guide and so we also have an audio commentary that has been specially recorded for the bus tour by the tourist office. Headphones are available on the bus and these are easy to operate. There is no extra charge for these - just plug in, select the required language and adjust the volume.<br>\
Due to the winter months being rather cold and wet in Pacton- on-Sea, the bus tours only operate from March to September. The weather is usually warm and sunny during these months so remember to bring some sun protection, especially on hot days. And of course, it does occasionally rain here in the summer so if the weather looks bad, remember to bring some rainwear. The bus tours are available no matter what the weather.<br>\
At the height of the summer the tours can get very busy so you are advised to book. You can book tickets online, over the phone and also at the station and at any of the other tour stops. When booking over the phone you can collect your tickets at any of the stops at the start of your tour. When you do it online you can print your e-ticket which you must remember to bring with you.<br>\
Thank you for calling the Pacton-on-Sea phoneline and we look forward to seeing you soon on one of our tour buses."
