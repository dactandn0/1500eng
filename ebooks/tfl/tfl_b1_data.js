Sonia was very well dressed. She had on a jacket and a long, dark blue skirt. She was also wearing a yellow blouse. She wasn't carrying a bag, but she did have a small wallet with her. Oh, and I remember she had nice gold earrings. I also remember her shoes. She was wearing black shoes with very high heels.<br>\
2.<br>\
Brian was very casually dressed. He was wearing some really old jeans—you know, the ones with holes in them—with a new wide leather belt and a white T-shirt. He had on some boots, high brown ones. They looked really nice. He also had a red scarf. He usually wears a couple of big rings, but he wasn't wearing any at the party. He was wearing an interesting silver watch, though.<br>\
3.<br>\
Kevin was wearing a yellow shirt and a green tie. I didn't like the tie, but I liked the shirt. He also had on brown pants. He was wearing sneakers with long white socks—kind of cute, actually. And he had a leather bag over one shoulder.<br>\
4.<br>\
Mrs. Graham looked really good. She had on an interesting long red skirt and a beautiful gold and black jacket. And she had some lovely earrings and a nice necklace. She also had a long pink scarf over one shoulder. She didn't have a bag. She was wearing sandals."

Sonia ăn mặc rất đẹp. Cô ấy mặc một chiếc áo khoác và một chiếc váy dài màu xanh đậm. Cô ấy cũng mặc một chiếc áo cánh màu vàng. Cô ấy không mang theo túi xách, nhưng cô ấy có một chiếc ví nhỏ bên mình. À, và tôi nhớ cô ấy có đôi bông tai vàng đẹp. Tôi cũng nhớ đôi giày của cô ấy. Cô ấy đi giày đen với gót rất cao.<br>\
2.<br>\
Brian ăn mặc rất giản dị. Anh ấy mặc một chiếc quần jean rất cũ—bạn biết đấy, loại có lỗ thủng—với một chiếc thắt lưng da bản rộng mới và một chiếc áo phông trắng. Anh ấy đi một đôi bốt cao màu nâu. Chúng trông thực sự đẹp. Anh ấy cũng có một chiếc khăn quàng cổ màu đỏ. Anh ấy thường đeo một vài chiếc nhẫn lớn, nhưng anh ấy không đeo chiếc nào trong bữa tiệc. Tuy nhiên, anh ấy đeo một chiếc đồng hồ bạc khá thú vị.<br>\
3.<br>\
Kevin mặc một chiếc áo sơ mi màu vàng và cà vạt màu xanh lá cây. Tôi không thích chiếc cà vạt, nhưng tôi thích chiếc áo sơ mi. Anh ấy cũng mặc quần nâu. Anh ấy đi giày thể thao với tất dài màu trắng—thực ra thì khá dễ thương. Và anh ấy đeo một chiếc túi da trên một vai.<br>\
4.<br>\
Bà Graham trông thực sự ổn. Bà mặc một chiếc váy dài màu đỏ thú vị và một chiếc áo khoác vàng và đen tuyệt đẹp. Bà đeo một số đôi bông tai đáng yêu và một chiếc vòng cổ đẹp. Bà cũng đeo một chiếc khăn dài màu hồng trên một vai. Bà không có túi. Bà đi dép xăng đan."

Yes, it can be. I don't like the long hours. I'm always really tired when I get home at night.<br>\
That's too bad. Why don't you quit?<br>\
Because I think my boss is great to work for.<br>\

Vậy Bill, anh thấy công việc của anh thế nào?<br>\
Ồ, lúc đầu thì ổn, nhưng giờ, sau hai năm, tôi không thích nữa.<br>\
Ồ, tại sao thế?<br>\
Chán quá. Tôi làm cùng một việc mỗi ngày. Tôi thực sự phát ngán với nó.<br>\
Vậy sao anh không đổi việc?<br>\
Tôi được trả lương cao. Tôi thích tiền!<br>\

Ừ, có lẽ tôi nên nghỉ.<br>\

Ồ, có chứ! Tôi thích làm việc với trẻ em. Chúng rất vui.<br>\
Ồ, tôi đoán là anh có công việc hoàn hảo!<br>\
Ồ, tôi rất thích công việc đó. Chỉ có một điều tôi không thích.<br>\
Cái gì thế?<br>\
Khoảng cách đến trường. Quá xa. Tôi phải mất một giờ lái xe đến đó mỗi ngày.<br>\
Ôi trời. Chắc là tệ lắm!<br>\
Đúng là vậy, nhưng những trường học gần tôi thì không tốt bằng.<br>\

Tốt, cảm ơn bạn. Tôi thực sự thích công việc đó.<br>\
Bạn thích nhất điều gì ở công việc đó?<br>\
Tôi nghĩ đó là những người tôi làm việc cùng. Họ rất tốt.<br>\
Con người tạo nên sự khác biệt trong công việc, đúng không?<br>\
Họ thực sự tốt. Vấn đề duy nhất là tôi phải đi công tác rất nhiều. Tôi xa nhà khoảng hai tuần mỗi tháng.<br>\
Đúng vậy, điều đó có thể khó khăn.<br>\
Đúng vậy. Tôi hy vọng năm sau tôi sẽ không phải đi công tác nhiều như vậy.<br>\

Có, tôi thích. Tôi được gặp rất nhiều người.<br>\
Công việc này có vất vả không?<br>\
Có, có thể. Tôi không thích giờ làm việc dài. Tôi luôn rất mệt mỏi khi về nhà vào ban đêm.<br>\
Thật tệ. Tại sao bạn không nghỉ việc?<br>\
Bởi vì tôi nghĩ sếp của tôi là người tuyệt vời để làm việc cùng.<br>\
5<br>\

Hơn năm năm rồi.<br>\
Ồ. Bạn hẳn phải thích lắm.<br>\
Ồ không, tôi không thích chút nào! Công việc này vất vả và cũng khá mệt mỏi. Tôi phải đứng suốt đêm.<br>\

I think exercise is so important to good health. There is a really good sports club near my school. During the week, I play tennis there for an hour before school starts. On weekends, I usually work out at the gym near my house for a few hours. I also play baseball with some friends from school. It's so much fun!<br>\
2.<br>\
I don't like jogging or doing anything too energetic. I prefer taking walks. I like to take a short walk every day through the park across from my house. Sometimes my boyfriend goes with me. It's nice to talk and look at the flowers and trees. On Sunday, I like to swim, but for only about a half hour. I sleep the rest of the weekend.<br>\
3.<br>\
I am a big football fan, but I only watch it on TV. I can't stand playing it! There are great games to watch on the weekend. I also enjoy watching tennis. I'd like to learn someday, but I don't like to sweat. I love chess and often play with my younger sister. She's really good at it and usually wins. On the weekends, I love to play video games with some of my friends.<br>\
4.<br>\
I just love to exercise! I like many different sports. Let's see…. I like swimming a lot. I get up very early, around 5 a.m., and swim for two hours from Monday to Friday. I also enjoy basketball and play with a group of friends from work every Tuesday night. And I've also started playing golf this year. Before playing, I go jogging to warm up.<br>\
5.<br>\
I enjoy exercise, but I don't do it as much as I should. I meet a friend every Wednesday and we play tennis. I'm not a very good player, but it's fun and we usually play for an hour. On weekends, I like to bicycle in our neighborhood. I guess I spend an hour or two doing that. Oh, and I love baseball, but only watching it while sitting on the couch eating popcorn!"

Tôi nghĩ tập thể dục rất quan trọng đối với sức khỏe. Có một câu lạc bộ thể thao thực sự tốt gần trường tôi. Trong tuần, tôi chơi quần vợt ở đó một giờ trước khi vào học. Vào cuối tuần, tôi thường tập thể dục tại phòng tập thể dục gần nhà trong vài giờ. Tôi cũng chơi bóng chày với một số người bạn ở trường. Thật vui!<br>\
2.<br>\
Tôi không thích chạy bộ hoặc làm bất cứ điều gì quá năng động. Tôi thích đi bộ. Tôi thích đi bộ một đoạn ngắn mỗi ngày qua công viên đối diện nhà tôi. Đôi khi bạn trai tôi đi cùng tôi. Thật tuyệt khi được nói chuyện và ngắm hoa và cây cối. Vào Chủ Nhật, tôi thích bơi, nhưng chỉ trong khoảng nửa giờ. Tôi ngủ suốt phần còn lại của cuối tuần.<br>\

Tôi là một người hâm mộ bóng đá lớn, nhưng tôi chỉ xem bóng đá trên TV. Tôi không thể chịu được việc chơi bóng đá! Có những trận đấu tuyệt vời để xem vào cuối tuần. Tôi cũng thích xem quần vợt. Tôi muốn học một ngày nào đó, nhưng tôi không thích đổ mồ hôi. Tôi thích cờ vua và thường chơi với em gái mình. Em ấy chơi rất giỏi và thường thắng. Vào cuối tuần, tôi thích chơi trò chơi điện tử với một số người bạn của mình.<br>\

Tôi chỉ thích tập thể dục! Tôi thích nhiều môn thể thao khác nhau. Hãy xem nào…. Tôi rất thích bơi lội. Tôi dậy rất sớm, khoảng 5 giờ sáng, và bơi trong hai giờ từ thứ Hai đến thứ Sáu. Tôi cũng thích bóng rổ và chơi với một nhóm bạn từ nơi làm việc vào mỗi tối thứ Ba. Và tôi cũng bắt đầu chơi golf trong năm nay. Trước khi chơi, tôi chạy bộ để khởi động.<br>\
5.<br>\
Tôi thích tập thể dục, nhưng tôi không tập nhiều như tôi nên làm. Tôi gặp một người bạn vào mỗi thứ Tư và chúng tôi chơi quần vợt. Tôi không phải là một người chơi giỏi, nhưng nó rất vui và chúng tôi thường chơi trong một giờ. Vào cuối tuần, tôi thích đạp xe quanh khu phố của mình. Tôi đoán tôi dành một hoặc hai giờ để làm điều đó. À, và tôi thích bóng chày, nhưng chỉ xem nó trong khi ngồi trên ghế dài ăn bỏng ngô!"
