Unfortunately, I haven’t learned to play any musical instrument yet, which is a pity. I had the first crack at playing the piano when I was a child but then it’s a shame I didn’t have enough time to do X. I was always snowed under homework and assignments at school and gave up after some weeks. I wish I had more ambition and patience when I was younger, then I might have learned to play the piano."

FE: What is the best time for traveling in your country?<br>\
-> I think summer months are the greatest time to travel around my country. This is because the weather during these months is hot and sunny, which is very suitable for outdoor activities, such as mountain climbing, camping, fishing or sightseeing.<br>\
C2: Tùy trường hợp (It depends./It depends on) + Lý do/ chi tiết<br>\
FE: What is the best time of day to study? <br>\
I reckon it really depends on people's preferences. For me, for example, morning is the best time of day to study because I feel that my brain functions most effectively from 8am to 11am. However, some people think that evening is the greatest time to study because they find themselves more focused on their work during this time.<br>\

Practice<br>\
1) What is the best time of day to work out? <br>\
It depends on people's schedules and preferences. I feel that evening is the best time to work out because I find myself most energetic during this time. However, some people think early morning is the ideal time to exercise because this is when they find themselves most relaxed. They don't have to worry about work or anything like that.<br>\
2) What is the best time to find a good job in your country?<br>\
It depends on the type of job you are talking about. You can easily find a well-paid job in restaurants, hotels or bars during the summer months because of the dramatic increase in the number of tourists. However, generally speaking, you can find jobs all year round as long as you have the relevant degrees or something to show that you're qualified for the job you're applying for.<br>\

<br>\
Nối giữa quá khứ và hiện tại: However, nowadays, there has been a noticeable transformation<br>\
1.  How has your hometown changed in recent years?<br>\
I have to say it has changed a great deal over the past few years. 10 years ago, the streets were often narrow, and tall buildings were few and far between. However, in recent years, there has been a noticeable transformation. Nowadays, main streets have been significantly widened, and numerous (=many) shopping malls and high-rise buildings have been constructed.<br>\
2.  How have shops changed in your town in the last five years<br>\
They haven't changed much; most of them are still small and family-run. The only notable change is that several years ago, they didn't accept credit or debit cards, so I had to pay in cash. However, recently, some shops have started accepting electronic transactions, making it easier to make purchases.<br>\
3. How has education changed in the past 10 years? <br>\
I believe education has undergone significant changes over the past 10 years. A decade ago, students primarily relied on textbooks and attended classes regularly, as e-learning wasn't as prevalent. However, in recent years, an increasing number of students have decided to take online courses rather than traditional classes. It is much easier for them to access all study materials to meet their learning needs.<br>\
4. How have TV shows in your country changed over the years?<br>\
Well, there have been significant changes over time. In the past, TV shows were mostly locally produced, with few international programs. However, in recent years, international TV shows and movies have come to dominate our television screens. I believe this shift is largely due to globalization and the growing influence of Western cultures.<br>\
5. In what ways have families in your country change in recent years<br>\
Well, families have undergone significant changes over the past decades. In the past, it was common for three or four generations to live under the same roof. However, nowadays, nuclear and single-parent families have become more popular.<br>\
Traditionally, fathers took on the role of the family breadwinner, while mothers stayed at home and took on childcare responsibilities. Nowadays, however, more men are choosing to stay at home and take care of the children, while women pursue careers outside the home.<br>\

	,en:"C1: Có + Lý do/ chi tiết<br>\
- Yes, I think so<br>\
- Yes, it’s very suitable for/ appropriate for<br>\
- Yes, it would be a great idea …<br>\
<br>\
1.  Do you think it’s appropriate for museums to sell things to visitors?<br>\
Yes, it would be a great idea because museums need money for operation (vận hành) and maintenance. Plus, many people like to buy something at the places they visit to give to their loved ones as a gift.<br>\
C2: Không + Lý do/ chi tiết<br>\
- No, I don’t think so<br>\
- No, not really<br>\
- No, it’s not really suitable<br>\
- No, I don’t think it’s a good idea<br>\
2.  Is your hometown suitable for young people to live in?<br>\
No, I don't think so because there are not many job opportunities in my town. That's why many young people leave for major cities in search of better jobs and career growth.<br>\
C3: Tùy<br>\
- It depends.<br>\
- It depends on...<br>\
FE: Are computers suitable for young children?<br>\
Well, it depends on how they use computers. If they’re learning through online courses or watching educational TV shows, then I think it's beneficial. But if they’re mainly chatting or playing games, computers might not be as ideal for them.<br>\
<br>\
PRACTICE<br>\
1.  Do you think bicycles are suitable for people of all ages?<br>\
a simple + effective way<br>\
stay active<br>\
cycling<br>\
children: fun outdoor activity<br>\
adults: commuting or exercise<br>\
older people: electric or three-wheeled bicycles<br>\
<br>\
Absolutely! Bicycles work for everyone, no matter their age. Whether you're a kid or a grandparent, hopping on a bike is a great way to unwind and stay healthy<br>\
Yes, I think bicycles are suitable for people of all ages because they offer a convenient and eco-friendly way to travel. Children can enjoy cycling as a fun outdoor activity, while adults often use bikes for commuting or exercise. Even older people can ride, especially if they choose models with extra support, like electric or three-wheeled bicycles.<br>\
<br>\
2. Is working from home suitable for all jobs?<br>\
IT, writing, or customer service<br>\
doctors: be in hospitals -> treat patients<br>\
construction workers: on-site -> build things<br>\
hard to stay focused<br>\
creative jobs, like filmmaking or product design, rely on face-to-face collaboration<br>\
have stable  internet connection + right equipment  <br>\
No, not really. Working from home works well for some jobs, like IT, writing, or customer service, but not for everything. Jobs like doctors, construction workers, or factory employees need to be done in person. Plus, some people find it hard to stay focused or miss the teamwork that comes with an office. So yeah, it’s great for some, but definitely not for all jobs…<br>\
<br>\
3. Is studying abroad suitable for everyone?<br>\
