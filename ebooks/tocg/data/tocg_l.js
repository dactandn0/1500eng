2) Over 800000 people in the US are estimated to have tried skiing. This may seem a large number but it represents just over 0,26% of the total population of 300 million. So, per capita, it is surprisingly small.<br>\
3) It's estimated that India is home to between 38000 and<br>\
53000 wild elephants, while Africa has between 470000 and 690000. Exact figures are difficult to determine. <br>\
4) An elephant can weigh between 2,5 and 5 tonnes. This is comparable to the tongue of the blue whale, which alone can weigh 2,7 tonnes. In fact, a blue whale can weigh 15 times more than an elephant, and can grow to about 10 times the size of a standard bus."

As you know, there are some attractive and well-established plants in there and we didn't want to take any of these out. But many of these are struggling in the harsh sun, which falls directly on that area. To solve this we're going to plant trees along the western edge of the garden, just near the pond. This should also become a very pleasant place to sit and watch the ducks in the water.<br>\

Studying ice cores in the South Pole can tell us a lot about the past climate, which, in turn, can help us understand how today's climate is changing. My particular area of study is snow. While we scientists understand the process of how snow is created, very little is known about how snow interacts with the atmosphere and influences our weather patterns. One of the things we're trying to do is to link what we already know about meteorology and clouds and determine the impact that snow has on that."

It has some amazing features. The first thing you notice is how much slimmer and lighter it is compared to the heavier older models. It's incredible considering that they have actually increased the screen size on this one, though it still fits neatly into your pocket. They've also improved the camera and you'll find you can take much better quality photos on this model. This has an impact on the battery though, as it takes a lot of power and I found it didn't run for very long before needing to be recharged. Despite all its amazing features, it's extremely easy to use, but I do have to say that it is overpriced, and will be beyond the budget of most people shopping for a new phone."

The Traviston Frog is different to many other species of frog. It is very small and so, unlike other species, it is unable to live in the area of a pond, though it does need to live in fairly close proximity to water so that it can feed. Rather than choosing the safety of a tree, which would be too tall and may actually increase the threat from predators, it elects to live in a tiny burrow surrounded by bushes."

So, I just wanted to give you a briefing about what you can find where. The information booth is to the right of the entrance and I've given you all a plan to mark important places on. One of the most common enquiries is where can I pay for my parking? People are amazed when we tell them that it's free now. We used to charge for it and there was a ticket booth to the left of the entrance, but now that it's been turned into a small stage, we hold cookery demonstrations there. Local chefs come in and show people how to prepare dishes. It's really popular and you get a nice view of the fountain there. We have over 50 stalls at the markets, selling everything from fresh fruit and vegetables to locally made crafts. Which unfortunately means people won't find things like books or anything second-hand. We have a famous baker at the market and many people get here really early just to buy his produce. His stall is located at the back of the markets next to the barbecue. We sell burgers and sausages there but a lot of people like to bring their own lunch to eat and they're welcome to go to the special area near the tree in the middle of the markets where they can do just that. It's handy for the toilets too. The markets are located next to a circus school that holds classes for children at the weekend, so we often get a lot of family groups in. There's a playground on the right-hand side that's popular with them, and just in front of that is where the farmers bring along chickens, rabbits and lambs for the children to pet. That's always a very popular feature so you'll definitely be asked about that. Just let people know there is a small fee if the children want to feed them. Well, that's everything for now..."

It's basically a set of interconnected cogs and wheels that rotate in turn and cause a party popper to pop! The process begins with what I like to call the party starter! It's located on the top of the base at the front. I was very fond of wind-up toys when I was young, but sadly I couldn't find a way to attach a winder to this contraption, but I think this big round button looks nice and dramatic and my children fight over getting to push it! The button activates a small motor that's housed directly under the box at the front. It generates enough power to get everything going but not so much that it overheats and needs a cooling fan! The legs elevate the base and help with that. The base also has another use as it can also hold up to 10 spare party poppers! So you never need to worry about running out. Once the motor is running, it turns the spiky wheel that is attached to the loaded party popper. I call this the detonator! As it turns, the string of the party popper slowly wraps around it and is pulled tighter and tighter until it explodes! So much fun!"

B: Vâng, anh ấy có thể kiểm tra giúp chúng ta và đảm bảo rằng chúng ta đã làm đủ. Nhưng tôi muốn làm điều đó sau khi chúng ta đã tổng hợp tất cả lại. Hiện tại, chúng ta chỉ có rất nhiều ghi chú viết tay. Tôi không muốn cho anh ấy xem. A: Được. Chúng ta hãy chia tài liệu ra và mỗi người ghi vào một đĩa để chúng ta có thể in ra một bản sao được trình bày đẹp mắt."

	,en:"Good morning, everyone. My name is Paul and I'm a palaeontologist. Now, when most people hear that, they immediately get an image of an old professor studying dried-up dinosaur bones or else they think of a great adventurer from the movies! Well, I'm neither. But I would like to talk to you today about how I came to be a palaeontologist and the reason I believe it is an important job. All my life, my main interest has been the environment. So, I actually started out as an ecology student. As a part of my degree course, I had to do a compulsory unit on extinction and a lecturer visiting from another university gave us a talk on Australia's extinct animals. One of the animals he talked about was called the Diprotodon. It's an ancestor of the modern Australian wombat. He described this enormous animal crossing ancient lakes, getting stuck in the mud and becoming part of the fossil record, which is what we call the preserved remains of animals and plants that we find. And I was fascinated. So fascinated that I immediately changed courses. But palaeontology isn't all easy going. The very first field trip I went on was pretty awful and we didn't find anything! We went to an outback fossil site and we were digging in extreme conditions. I've learned since then that that's pretty standard for work like this. But to make matters worse, after five days, I'd found nothing. I was getting really disheartened and I was starting to regret my decision, when on the last day of the trip, I was digging into the bank of an ancient dried-up riverbed and I found a funny-looking piece of rock. Inside it was a tooth from a giant kangaroo. Finding that one fossil made me realise that this was a field I really wanted to continue working in."
	,vi:"Chào buổi sáng, mọi người. Tôi tên là Paul và tôi là một nhà cổ sinh vật học. Khi nghe đến điều đó, hầu hết mọi người sẽ nghĩ ngay đến một giáo sư già đang nghiên cứu xương khủng long khô hoặc họ nghĩ đến một nhà thám hiểm vĩ đại trong phim! Vâng, tôi không phải là cả hai. Nhưng hôm nay tôi muốn nói chuyện với các bạn về cách tôi trở thành một nhà cổ sinh vật học và lý do tôi tin rằng đó là một công việc quan trọng. Trong suốt cuộc đời mình, mối quan tâm chính của tôi là môi trường. Vì vậy, thực ra tôi đã bắt đầu là một sinh viên ngành sinh thái học. Là một phần của khóa học cấp bằng, tôi phải học một đơn vị bắt buộc về sự tuyệt chủng và một giảng viên đến từ một trường đại học khác đã có bài nói chuyện về các loài động vật đã tuyệt chủng của Úc. Một trong những loài động vật mà ông ấy nói đến được gọi là Diprotodon. Đây là tổ tiên của loài wombat Úc hiện đại. Ông ấy đã mô tả loài động vật khổng lồ này băng qua các hồ nước cổ đại, bị mắc kẹt trong bùn và trở thành một phần của hồ sơ hóa thạch, đó là những gì chúng ta gọi là di tích được bảo tồn của động vật và thực vật mà chúng ta tìm thấy. Và tôi đã bị cuốn hút. Quá cuốn hút đến nỗi tôi đã ngay lập tức đổi hướng. Nhưng cổ sinh vật học không phải là tất cả dễ dàng. Chuyến đi thực tế đầu tiên của tôi khá tệ và chúng tôi không tìm thấy bất cứ thứ gì! Chúng tôi đã đến một địa điểm hóa thạch ở vùng hẻo lánh và chúng tôi đã đào trong điều kiện khắc nghiệt. Kể từ đó, tôi đã học được rằng đó là điều khá bình thường đối với công việc như thế này. Nhưng tệ hơn nữa, sau năm ngày, tôi không tìm thấy gì cả. Tôi thực sự nản lòng và bắt đầu hối hận về quyết định của mình, khi vào ngày cuối cùng của chuyến đi, tôi đang đào vào bờ của một lòng sông khô cạn cổ đại và tôi tìm thấy một mảnh đá trông kỳ lạ. Bên trong nó là một chiếc răng của một con kangaroo khổng lồ. Việc tìm thấy hóa thạch đó khiến tôi nhận ra rằng đây là một lĩnh vực mà tôi thực sự muốn tiếp tục làm việc."

	,en:"What I appreciate most about my work is the fact that I can turn the fossils I find into information we can actually use. So, how do we extract that information? Well, first we need to run the fossil through a special machine. That gives me a date for the fossil. From then on, I begin to work out what type of animal it was, what it ate and how it interacted with the landscape.<br>\
Earlier this year, I was lucky enough to be awarded a grant from a government-funding body. Palaeontology isn't only about the past. It can help with current issues too. For example, I plan to use these funds to excavate new areas and try to find out how ancient creatures evolved during their own period of climate change, just as animals today have to.<br>\
In another project, I'm going to study fossil collections that are housed in museums around Australia. I'm doing that to try to find out when Australia's mega-fauna became extinct - that is, all the giant mammals, lizards and birds. That will help us to finally find out what caused these extinctions. Was it nature or was it humans?"

We've recently been doing some research involving mice. We were trying to find out what causes the cells in our body to age. Is it linked to diet or exercise? What we found was that if we allowed the mice no exercise, their cells deteriorated fairly rapidly, giving them a prematurely old body. The mice that did exercise, showed less change in their cell structure and so seemed younger.<br>\

We've known for decades that pigeons can navigate using the Earth's magnetic field as a sort of compass. What we don't know is how this works. In our research, we discovered that the pigeon's brain receives a signal from its middle ear that the brain then processes to determine both their direction and the strength of the magnetic field. Previously, it had been thought that it was the bird's beak that held the answer. But this has since been proven false."

	,en:"In my talk today, I'm going to be looking at plants that have had an impact on our world and our history. Let's start with the potato. It was originally one of the staple foods of Central and South America and when Spanish explorers travelled to the Americas some time in the 16th century the potato found its way into Europe. This had several important consequences. In particular, it almost totally altered people's diet in many European countries. The potato is also believed to have been responsible for the start of a new trend - that of migrating to America. So you could say that the humble potato actually allowed many people to change their lives.<br>\
However, there were also problems associated with this crop. Largely in Ireland, where the poor were very much reliant on the success of the crops. Sadly, a disease in the crop spread rapidly across the country and led to widespread potato crop failures in the mid-1800s. This meant that millions died from starvation as a result.<br>\
Let's move on to look at another plant from the same part of the world, the tobacco plant. This originated in the Americas and had an enormous influence on the way North America developed in the 1800s. It's famed for being the original cash crop there and for funding a great deal of the development that occurred during this time.<br>\
On the downside, the success of this crop resulted in a greater demand for slaves to work the crops and this eventually led to war breaking out between the Northern States and those in the South.<br>\
Now, the next plant I'd like to mention is one known and used all around the world. Tea. It originated in China and in terms of its historical significance, it played a large part in the US independence from Great Britain. This came about because the British government declared that the colonies had to pay a tax on the produce brought into America. It was because of the protest against these taxes that the American Revolution came about.<br>\
The final plant I'll look at today is the White Mulberry. Again it originated in China and had an enormous influence on development in this part of the world, in particular in establishing trade between the East and the West. Sadly, the increase in trade brought with it the spread of disease and weapons."

	,en:"In today's lecture, I'm going to talk about the part that plants have played in our history, something most of us probably never give any thought to. Flowers began changing the way the world looked almost as soon as they appeared on Earth about 130 million years ago. That's relatively recent in geologic time - if all Earth's history were compressed into an hour, flowering plants would exist for only the last 90 seconds. Without those flowering plants, it's likely we wouldn't be here. They are fundamental to our existence, forming a vital part of our food supplies.<br>\
If we look further on in time, to the year 2737 BC, we arrive at the discovery of tea by a Chinese emperor, when a leaf fell into a cup of hot water. This discovery eventually played a very important part in the history of China, the USA and the UK. For Britain, where demand for tea was high, there were financial implications when a Chinese emperor declared that it could only be bought with silver, which they were then forced to find overseas.<br>\
A second influential plant emerged around 202 BC in the form of the White Mulberry. It became extremely sought after and it remained so until 220 AD because white mulberries provide food for the worm that creates silk. This luxurious material was responsible for establishing extremely valuable trade routes. And it was along these same routes that different religions made their way around the world. But, unfortunately, they also caused the spread of previously unknown diseases, as well as weapons of war such as gunpowder.<br>\
Finally, moving into more recent history, we come to the 16th century and the potato. It originated in Central America but it was the Spanish who introduced it to the European diet. There, it quickly became popular because not only did it cost little to grow, but it was also a food source that was rich in vitamins. So much so that its arrival has been credited with ridding Britain of a disease known as scurvy. However, it is perhaps more famous now for the potato famines of the mid- 1800s in Ireland. The Irish people were so dependent on the crop that its widespread failure over this period caused the deaths of over a million people and the emigration of a further million to mainland Britain, Canada and the US."
	,vi:"Trong bài giảng hôm nay, tôi sẽ nói về vai trò của thực vật trong lịch sử của chúng ta, một điều mà hầu hết chúng ta có lẽ chưa bao giờ nghĩ đến. Hoa bắt đầu thay đổi diện mạo thế giới ngay khi chúng xuất hiện trên Trái đất cách đây khoảng 130 triệu năm. Đó là khoảng thời gian tương đối gần đây trong lịch sử địa chất - nếu toàn bộ lịch sử Trái đất được nén lại trong một giờ, thì thực vật có hoa chỉ tồn tại trong 90 giây cuối cùng. Nếu không có những loài thực vật có hoa đó, có lẽ chúng ta sẽ không ở đây. Chúng là nền tảng cho sự tồn tại của chúng ta, tạo thành một phần thiết yếu trong nguồn cung cấp thực phẩm của chúng ta.<br>\
Nếu chúng ta nhìn xa hơn về mặt thời gian, đến năm 2737 trước Công nguyên, chúng ta sẽ đến với phát hiện về trà của một hoàng đế Trung Quốc, khi một chiếc lá trà rơi vào một cốc nước nóng. Phát hiện này cuối cùng đã đóng một vai trò rất quan trọng trong lịch sử của Trung Quốc, Hoa Kỳ và Vương quốc Anh. Đối với Anh, nơi nhu cầu về trà rất cao, đã có những tác động về mặt tài chính khi một hoàng đế Trung Quốc tuyên bố rằng trà chỉ có thể được mua bằng bạc, sau đó họ buộc phải tìm kiếm ở nước ngoài.<br>\
Một loại cây có ảnh hưởng thứ hai xuất hiện vào khoảng năm 202 trước Công nguyên dưới dạng Dâu tằm trắng. Nó trở nên cực kỳ được săn đón và vẫn như vậy cho đến năm 220 sau Công nguyên vì dâu tằm trắng cung cấp thức ăn cho loài sâu tạo ra tơ. Loại vật liệu xa xỉ này chịu trách nhiệm thiết lập các tuyến đường thương mại cực kỳ có giá trị. Và chính trên những tuyến đường này, nhiều tôn giáo khác nhau đã du nhập vào thế giới. Nhưng thật không may, chúng cũng gây ra sự lây lan của các căn bệnh chưa từng biết đến trước đây, cũng như các loại vũ khí chiến tranh như thuốc súng.<br>\
Cuối cùng, chuyển sang lịch sử gần đây hơn, chúng ta đến với thế kỷ 16 và khoai tây. Nó có nguồn gốc từ Trung Mỹ nhưng chính người Tây Ban Nha đã giới thiệu nó vào chế độ ăn uống của người châu Âu. Ở đó, nó nhanh chóng trở nên phổ biến vì không chỉ tốn ít chi phí để trồng mà còn là nguồn thực phẩm giàu vitamin. Nhiều đến mức sự xuất hiện của nó được cho là đã giúp Anh thoát khỏi căn bệnh được gọi là bệnh scorbut. Tuy nhiên, có lẽ nó nổi tiếng hơn hiện nay vì nạn đói khoai tây vào giữa những năm 1800 ở Ireland. Người dân Ireland phụ thuộc vào vụ mùa đến nỗi sự thất bại lan rộng của nó trong giai đoạn này đã gây ra cái chết của hơn một triệu người và khiến một triệu người khác phải di cư đến Anh, Canada và Hoa Kỳ."

A: Sure - what would you like to know?<br>\
B: Well - they said it takes place every Saturday, is that right? <br>\
A: Yes it does.<br>\
B: OK - great!<br>\
A: Do you know where the park is?<br>\
B: Oh yes - I've been there before. But it's quite big and I'm not sure where to go.<br>\
A: Well there's a circular track that goes right around the park. The run starts at the café, goes past the tennis courts then twice around the lake and finishes back where it started.<br>\
B: OK and what time is the run?<br>\
A: Well the actual run begins at 9 am but the runners start arriving at about 8,45.<br>\
B: OK so I need to get up early Saturday morning then. And how long is the run?<br>\
A: Well it used to be three kilometres but most people wanted to do a bit more than that so we lengthened it to five kilometres - we now go round the lake twice and that adds an extra two kilometres.<br>\
B: Right not sure I've ever run that far so I'd better start doing a bit of training.<br>\
A: That's a good idea. But it's not a race, it's really just for fun and the best thing would be to take it easy the first few times you do it and then see if you can gradually improve your time.<br>\
B: Is the run timed then? How do I know how well I've done?<br>\
A: When you cross the finish line you'll be given a bar code and you take this to one of the run volunteers, who will scan it. Then you can get your time online when you go home.<br>\
B: Oh I see. You collect all the results.<br>\
A: Exactly.<br>\
B: I see that's great. So how do I register?<br>\
A: Well there are several ways. I could take your details over the phone but it's much easier if you do it using the website.<br>\
B: OK - good. Um, I think that's probably all I need to know for now. Oh yes - does it cost anything to register or do you collect money each week?<br>\
A: Well it doesn't cost anything to register but we do charge for the run. In fact we have just increased the charge to £1,50. It used to be a pound but because we were making a bit of a loss we have had to increase it by 50p.<br>\

A: Sure well we need volunteers for basic stuff like setting up the course. We have to do that before all the runners arrive.<br>\
B: OK - so that's a really early start!<br>\
A: Yes that's right. But if your friend would prefer to arrive a bit later she can also help with guiding the runners so they don't go the wrong way.<br>\

	,en:"Thank you for calling the phoneline for the Pacton-on-Sea bus tour. This is a recorded message lasting approximately four minutes and it provides general information on the town bus tour. <br>\
Pacton-on-Sea is a beautiful west coast town and has attracted tourists for many years. One of the best ways of getting to know the town is to take the bus tour, which provides a wonderful viewing experience from one of our open-top buses. The tour is a round-trip of the town and there are a total of 4 stops where passengers can get on and off the bus. A lot of people start at the first stop which is at the train station as this is where many tourists arrive in the town. The next stop after the station is the aquarium which is famous for its dolphin show and which has recently expanded to include sharks. This is well worth a visit and is very reasonably priced. Leaving the aquarium, the bus tour goes along the coast road and after a few kilometres comes to the Old Fishing Village where you can get off to stroll along the waterfront. There are some original buildings here but most of the area has been modernised and is now used as a harbour for all kinds of sea craft including yachts and some amazing power boats. The tour then heads off to the last stop and this is where most of the shops are. So for those of you keen to do a bit of shopping this is the place for you. Our advice is to go to this part of the town in the morning when it is relatively quiet. It does get very busy in the afternoons, especially at the height of the season. This area of the town includes an ancient water fountain where many people like to have their photograph taken - so do look out for this.<br>\
[pause]<br>\
Now some details of the costs and timings. A family ticket, which includes two adults and up to three children, costs £30. An adult ticket costs £15, children under the age of fifteen are £5 and student tickets are £10 as long as you have a student card. All tickets are valid for 24 hours, which means that you can get on and off the bus as many times as you like within a 24-hour period. So you could, for example, start the tour in the afternoon and complete it the following morning. The first bus of the day leaves the station at 10 am and the last one of the day leaves at 6 pm. Buses leave every thirty minutes and each tour takes a total of fifty minutes. There are many attractions at each of the stops, so wherever you get off the bus there will be plenty to do. The bus tour tickets do not include entrance to any of these attractions apart from the museum which is located near the aquarium. Some buses have local guides, who will point out places of interest and will provide information on the town. However, we cannot guarantee that every bus will have a guide and so we also have an audio commentary that has been specially recorded for the bus tour by the tourist office. Headphones are available on the bus and these are easy to operate. There is no extra charge for these - just plug in, select the required language and adjust the volume.<br>\
Due to the winter months being rather cold and wet in Pacton- on-Sea, the bus tours only operate from March to September. The weather is usually warm and sunny during these months so remember to bring some sun protection, especially on hot days. And of course, it does occasionally rain here in the summer so if the weather looks bad, remember to bring some rainwear. The bus tours are available no matter what the weather.<br>\
At the height of the summer the tours can get very busy so you are advised to book. You can book tickets online, over the phone and also at the station and at any of the other tour stops. When booking over the phone you can collect your tickets at any of the stops at the start of your tour. When you do it online you can print your e-ticket which you must remember to bring with you.<br>\
Thank you for calling the Pacton-on-Sea phoneline and we look forward to seeing you soon on one of our tour buses."

If there was anything you could do, Randhir, to make the process more efficient, that would be really helpful.<br>\
Randhir: Well it sounds like you could do with an assistant but that's obviously not possible, so what about having an online system that students can use to do their scheduling? Dave: How would that work?<br>\
Randhir: Well - it may mean less choice for students but we could create a fixed schedule of all the courses and options and they could then view what was available ...<br>\
Dave:... and work it out for themselves that sounds great. <br>\
Randhir: OK, so... um... we'll need to decide whether or not to improve the existing system or to build a<br>\
completely new system.<br>\
Dave: Well I'd much prefer to have a new system. Quite frankly, I've had enough of the old one.<br>\
Randhir: OK - that'll probably take longer although it may save you money in the long run. When were you hoping to have this in place?<br>\
Dave: Well it's January now and the new intake of students will be in September. We need to start processing admissions in the next few weeks really.<br>\
Randhir: Well it will take more than a few weeks, I'm afraid. As an initial estimate I think we'll be looking at April or May to improve the existing system but for a new system it would take at least nine months. That would be October at the earliest. <br>\
[pause]<br>\
Dave: What are the next steps if we are to have a new system? Randhir: Well, the first question is - do you have support from your senior management?<br>\
Dave: Yes, I've already discussed it with them and they're also keen to get this work done.<br>\
Randhir: OK, because I was going to say, that's the first thing you need to do and without that we can't go ahead. Dave: Yes, I've done that.<br>\
Randhir: That's good.<br>\
Dave: Actually, they mentioned that there's probably a form I need to complete to formally start the project.<br>\
Randhir: Yes - that's the next thing you need to do. I'll send you an email with a link so you can fill it in online. It's called a 'project request form'.<br>\
Dave: OK, great. And then what happens?<br>\
Randhir: Well, I have a list of things but I think the third thing you should do is see Samir. He's our analyst who will look at the system and identify what needs to be done.<br>\
Dave: OK - can you send me his contact details and I'll set up a meeting with him.<br>\
Randhir: OK that's good, so we should soon be able to get a team together to start the work. Some members of our team work in different locations so it's not easy to have face-to-face meetings.<br>\
Dave: That's OK - I'm used to having conference calls providing they are not late at night.<br>\
Randhir: Right - so I'll send you details of the team and if you could set up a call that would be great.<br>\
Dave: OK, I'll do that.<br>\
Randhir: Thanks."

	,en:"Hi everyone today I'm going to be talking about the origins of ceramics. So, first of all, let's start off with - what is a ceramic? Well, generally speaking, ceramics are what you get when you apply heat to certain inorganic, non-metallic solids and then allow them to cool. And examples of ceramics are everyday things like earthenware pots, crockery, glassware and even concrete. <br>\
So how did it all begin? Well it all started around 29,000 years ago when humans discovered that if you dig up some soft clay from the ground, mould it into a shape and then heat it up to a very high temperature, when it cools the clay has been transformed into something hard and rigid. And so what did those first humans do with their discovery? Well - they created figurines which were small statues and which depicted animals or gods or any shape that the clay could be moulded into. And all this activity was centred around southern Europe where there is also evidence of ceramics that were created much later. The early humans also found a practical use for their discovery, such as storing things like grain - although there were drawbacks. The pots were porous so that, although they could carry water in them, it wasn't possible to store it over a long period. And also, they were quite brittle and shattered very easily if they were dropped.<br>\
But despite these problems, it was many thousands of years before there were any improvements. In China at around 200 BC, they discovered that by adding minerals to the clay they could improve both the appearance and the strength of the ceramics. But it took nearly a thousand years before they perfected the process to produce high-quality ceramics known as porcelain. And once they had perfected the process, they kept it a secret for another thousand years! Compared to the first ceramics, porcelain was lighter, finer, harder and whiter and became an important commodity in China's trading with the rest of the world for hundreds of years. In fact, it became so valuable that it was known as white gold and spies were sent to China to discover what they did to the clay to produce such high-quality merchandise.<br>\
It wasn't until the eighteenth century that the secret began to unravel. A German alchemist called Johann Friedrich Bottger was asked by the king to make gold out of lead. Unfortunately, Bottger failed to achieve this and soon gave up, but in order to please the king he attempted to make high-quality porcelain. And after many years of experimentation, he discovered that by adding quartz and a material called china stone to very high-quality clay he managed to get the same results that the Chinese had been achieving for the last 1000 years.<br>\
We'll now look at another ceramic which is made from mixing sand with minerals and heating to over 600 degrees Celsius. When this mixture cools the result is of course glass. The main difference between ceramics made from clay and glass is that clay is made up of crystalline plates which become locked together in the cooling process whereas glass cools too quickly for crystals to form. Apart from that, the process of heating up naturally occurring materials to transform them is the same. The origins of glass date back to 3500 BC but it wasn't until the Roman Empire, 2,000 years ago, that the art of glass-blowing and the practical uses of glass became more widespread. One of the more innovative uses was to use it in windows as, up until then, they had just been holes in walls. It must have been very draughty in those days!<br>\
The Romans were also responsible for inventing concrete. And although the origins are uncertain, experts think that this is largely due to the high level of volcanic activity in the area. The Romans observed that, when volcanic ash mixes with water and then cools, it gets extremely hard and almost impossible to break up. The chemical reaction that follows is very complex and continues for many years, and the concrete just keeps getting harder. Evidence of this is the numerous Roman remains that are still standing, many of which are almost completely intact.<br>\
One of the most important facts about concrete for the Romans was that it can be created underwater. As the Roman Empire grew, the Romans needed to take control of the seas and for this they needed to build harbours capable of holding a fleet of ships. Pouring concrete mixture into the sea immediately started the hardening process and rather than just dissolving in the mass of water, the substance was tough and long-lasting. This strange characteristic of concrete made a significant contribution to the success of the Roman Empire."
