<br>\
2. What do you like about living there?<br>\
I like that most of the rooms face south, which means we get a lot of natural light. And the location is very convenient as all the facilities and services are within walking distance, which means I can easily grab anything I need in just a few minutes.<br>\
<br>\
3. What is your favorite room?<br>\
I would say that it's the living room because it's the most spacious room in the house, with a comfy sofa and a big, round table where we eat dinner every night. That's the room where the whole family gathers together and shares ups and downs in our lives.<br>\

There are three advantages of tourism for local people and the environment.\
 First of all, tourism can bring in money for local people because tourists often buy souvenirs when they travel to another country.\
  Secondly, tourism can create more job opportunities for people so they will have more money. Finally, it can educate tourists about the environment so they can protect it better.<br>\
However, there are also three disadvantages of tourism.\
 Firstly, new hotels and resorts can destroy the living of endangered species. Secondly, tourism can create traffic jams because many people come to visit the country.\
  Lastly, tourism can increase food prices for local people because shops are designed for tourists"

Last year, on the occasion of my 16th birthday, my mother gave me a very precious gift, which is an iPhone 6s. I have used it both in study and entertainment every day.<br>\
My smartphone is considered as one of my modern educational tools. Only with the phone connected to the Internet, I can access and surf webs to broaden my knowledge. For example, when there are lessons that I don't understand in class, I can use it to search for lectures and videos online, which is really helpful.<br>\
Moreover, I can download a lot of games or books, music, movies and they are free. As a result, after tiring lessons, this will be a good way to relieve stress and get back my energy. For instance, when I do the housework with my mother, I regularly listen to my favorite songs. In addition, it helps me to keep in touch with my family and my friends. When I want to make contact with my classmates, I can text messages or make video calls and we can easily see each other's faces.<br>\

	title:"Pros & Cons of city you live in",
	en:"<b>Pros:</b><br>\
Fantastic, long beach. Walkable promenade next to the beach. I walk here every day.<br>\
Cheapest beachside city I've ever been to. Accommodation can vary depending on your needs and how long you book for, but much cheaper than Thailand imo.<br>\
Amazing food. Banh mi are less than $2. Plenty of amazing food to be had for incredibly cheap prices. Like everyone, I'd heard of Banh Mi and Pho but I've been falling in love with other Vietnamese dishes like Banh Xeo and Vietnamese pastries. All of which are usually less than $2-$3.<br>\
Cafe culture in Vietnam is better than anywhere else on Earth imo. You're never more than a block away from a cafe. Go for a 10 min walk and you'll see at least 5. Coffee is $0.50 - $2 and delicious. Make sure to try egg coffee!<br>\
I've only been here for 2-3 weeks and haven't had a chance to explore the mountains yet, but I can follow up once they do. So far, it's amazing scenery at least!<br>\
<b>Cons:</b><br>\
Number one con is Vietnamese visa policy. Currently you can still only stay for 30 days on a tourist visa, although the government indicated last week they are looking at changing this. If they bring back 3 month tourist visas, I'll be staying in DN for at least another 3 months. For now, visa runs to Laos by bus are about $110 USD for Americans. So fairly pricey to stay here doing visa runs.<br>\
This is common throughout Vietnam, but Da Nang definitely suffers from noise pollution. I never thought of myself as a person who would be bothered by this, but it's definitely affected me since I got here. I've stayed in 2 Airbnbs and a hotel since I got here, and in each I was kept awake by karaoke, bars, or large groups of people sitting in the streets eating and drinking until late in the night. Vietnamese are very social and, imo, much louder than say Thailand.<br>\
If you're a big city person, you might get a little bored of Da Nang. There's a lot to see and do, but nowhere near the level of Bangkok or Ho Chi Minh City. For me, I actually don't usually like the mega metropolises, I find them a little overwhelming for a 1-3 month stay, so Da Nang is great for me.<br>\
This one might not be a huge issue, but I've found compared to Thailand, there seems to be more tourist scams in Vietnam in general. Lots of Japanese restaurants that will pad the bill assuming you won't check or even care as a foreigner. I've had some pretty bad luck on Airbnb so far, and most of the time hosts will do the usual tricks, like refuse to give a refund, ask me to cancel first, offer to take you to one of their 'other' places which is usually far worse, etc. In general it feels like Vietnamese are more focused on making money off of you in any way they can compared to Thais. I think this is amplified in Da Nang because it's such a popular tourist destination. Not a huge dealbreaker but something to be aware of imo."
	,vi:"Ưu điểm:<br>\
Bãi biển dài tuyệt đẹp. Có thể đi bộ dạo bộ bên cạnh bãi biển. Tôi đi bộ ở đây mỗi ngày.<br>\
<br>\
Thành phố ven biển rẻ nhất mà tôi từng đến. Chỗ ở có thể thay đổi tùy theo nhu cầu của bạn và thời gian bạn đặt phòng, nhưng theo tôi thì rẻ hơn nhiều so với Thái Lan.<br>\
<br>\
Đồ ăn tuyệt vời. Bánh mì có giá dưới 2 đô la. Có rất nhiều món ăn tuyệt vời với giá cực rẻ. Giống như mọi người, tôi đã nghe nói về Bánh mì và Phở nhưng tôi đã yêu thích các món ăn Việt Nam khác như Bánh Xèo và bánh ngọt Việt Nam. Tất cả đều có giá dưới 2-3 đô la.<br>\
<br>\
Theo tôi thì văn hóa quán cà phê ở Việt Nam tốt hơn bất kỳ nơi nào khác trên Trái đất. Bạn không bao giờ cách một quán cà phê quá một dãy nhà. Đi bộ 10 phút và bạn sẽ thấy ít nhất 5 quán. Cà phê có giá từ 0,50 - 2 đô la và rất ngon. Hãy thử cà phê trứng nhé!<br>\
<br>\
Tôi mới chỉ ở đây 2-3 tuần và chưa có cơ hội khám phá những ngọn núi, nhưng tôi có thể quay lại sau khi họ khám phá. Cho đến nay, ít nhất thì cảnh đẹp ở đây cũng tuyệt vời!<br>\
<br>\
Nhược điểm:<br>\
Nhược điểm số một là chính sách thị thực của Việt Nam. Hiện tại, bạn vẫn chỉ có thể ở lại 30 ngày với thị thực du lịch, mặc dù tuần trước chính phủ đã chỉ ra rằng họ đang xem xét thay đổi chính sách này. Nếu họ đưa thị thực du lịch 3 tháng trở lại, tôi sẽ ở lại DN ít nhất 3 tháng nữa. Hiện tại, chi phí đi xe buýt đến Lào để xin thị thực là khoảng 110 đô la Mỹ cho người Mỹ. Vì vậy, ở lại đây để xin thị thực khá đắt.<br>\
<br>\
Điều này phổ biến ở khắp Việt Nam, nhưng Đà Nẵng chắc chắn phải chịu ô nhiễm tiếng ồn. Tôi chưa bao giờ nghĩ mình là người sẽ bận tâm đến điều này, nhưng nó chắc chắn đã ảnh hưởng đến tôi kể từ khi tôi đến đây. Tôi đã ở 2 Airbnb và một khách sạn kể từ khi đến đây, và ở mỗi nơi, tôi đều thức trắng đêm vì karaoke, quán bar hoặc những nhóm người đông đúc ngồi trên phố ăn uống đến tận khuya. Người Việt Nam rất hòa đồng và theo tôi, ồn ào hơn nhiều so với Thái Lan.<br>\
<br>\
Nếu bạn là người thành phố lớn, bạn có thể sẽ thấy hơi chán Đà Nẵng. Có rất nhiều thứ để xem và làm, nhưng không thể sánh bằng Bangkok hay TP.HCM. Đối với tôi, thực ra tôi không thích các thành phố lớn, tôi thấy chúng hơi quá sức đối với một kỳ nghỉ kéo dài 1-3 tháng, vì vậy Đà Nẵng là nơi tuyệt vời đối với tôi.<br>\
<br>\
Điều này có thể không phải là vấn đề lớn, nhưng tôi thấy rằng so với Thái Lan, có vẻ như có nhiều vụ lừa đảo khách du lịch hơn ở Việt Nam nói chung. Rất nhiều nhà hàng Nhật Bản sẽ tính thêm tiền nếu bạn là người nước ngoài và không kiểm tra hoặc thậm chí không quan tâm. Tôi đã gặp một số điều không may trên Airbnb cho đến nay, và hầu hết thời gian, chủ nhà sẽ làm những trò thông thường, như từ chối hoàn lại tiền, yêu cầu tôi hủy trước, đề nghị đưa bạn đến một trong những nơi 'khác' của họ, thường tệ hơn nhiều, v.v. Nhìn chung, có vẻ như người Việt Nam tập trung nhiều hơn vào việc kiếm tiền từ bạn theo bất kỳ cách nào họ có thể so với người Thái. Tôi nghĩ điều này được khuếch đại ở Đà Nẵng vì đây là một điểm đến du lịch rất nổi tiếng. Không phải là một sự phá vỡ thỏa thuận lớn nhưng theo tôi, đây là điều cần lưu ý."

	en:"<u>Sport</u><br>I would like to talk about my favorite sport, which is football, the king of sport to everyone in Vietnam. It’s absolutely great!<br>\
You can play it in so many places, inside, in a pitch or a stadium, or outside, in a park.<br>\
The rules of football are really easy/simple. You play in teams of … people. You have to kick the ball into the opponent's net (lưới của đối thủ).<br>\
Players can use any part of their body except(ngoại trừ) their hands and arms, although the goalkeeper is an exception as they can use their hands within the penalty area. The team with the most goals at the end of the match wins.<br>\
I love this sport for several reasons: First, ... Second,... Last but not least, ...<br><br>\
<u>Area of natural beauty</u><br>\
One special place of natural beauty that I would like to talk about is Ha Long Bay. Ha Long Bay is located in the northern part of Vietnam, in Quang Ninh province. It is famous for its stunning limestone islands that rise out of the emerald-green water. The bay has thousands of small islands, some with caves and beaches, and the scenery is really breathtaking.<br>\
<br>\
I have been to Ha Long Bay once, during a family trip. We took a boat tour around the bay and stopped at some of the islands to explore the caves. The water was calm, and the atmosphere was peaceful. I remember how quiet and beautiful it was, with the sun setting behind the rocks, making everything glow.<br>\
<br>\
Ha Long Bay is special to me because of its natural beauty and how peaceful it felt. It’s also a place where I felt really connected to nature. Being there made me feel relaxed and happy.\
It’s a perfect place to escape from the busy city life and enjoy something truly unique.<br><br>\

		title:"[W] Pros && cons eating fast food and using technology in study",
		en:"There are three advantages of eating fast food in our daylife. First of all, eating fast food helps our mood feel better. There are wide ranges of available dishes, even on the pavement. As a result, people could get food easily on bustle and hustle working days. Besides, we can always try new meals, and, likely, you won't grow bored because there are so many fast food options available, primarily if you reside in a big city. Secondly, eating fast food helps us avoid food waste. There are frequently leftovers when you prepare meals at home. They can be placed in the refrigerator with the best intentions, but the food is often wasted. When you order fast food, you get what you need for that specific meal, so there is nothing left to store in the fridge, and nothing is wasted. Finally, Fast food is also very convenient while traveling. While traveling, you wouldn't have time to prepare for your meal, so you might as well grab some fast food. You'll not only skip cooking, but you'll also escape having to clean the dishes afterward. Consequently, when traveling, fast food is an excellent alternative to cooking because you can spend additional time on trips and learning about the local culture.<br>\
However, there are also three disadvantages of consuming fast food. Firstly, it has a lot of unhealthy ingredients and is typically lacking in essential vitamins and minerals. Despite the possibility of certain nutritious goods, the most popular dishes at fast food restaurants are frequently quite harmful. As a result, over time, your level of fitness, as well as your general quality of life, may decline significantly. Secondly, it contains calories, and makes people get fat. Besides, fast food isn't a smart choice for weight loss because it is high in calories. Lastly, there are a lot of low quality but expensive foods of unknown origin. So, happy cooking with family at home can still be less expensive and safe.<br>\
In short, you should cook for yourself because cooking ensures you consume nutritious food, burn calories and cost less money than buying fast food. If you really love fast food, you should sometimes get it to protect yourself from bad ingredients and lose weight.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Pros</b><br>\
Mental health - help our mood feel better <br>\
Travelling - easy to bring when travelling<br>\
Time - waiting time is very short<br>\
Taste - amazing taste/tasty<br>\
Social life - provides a space to hang out<br>\
<b>Cons</b><br>\
Weight - can make people get fat<br>\
Physical health - overprocessed ingredients can cause heart disease<br>\
Price - not very affordable to eat daily<br>\
Addiction - may get addicted from eating fast food<br>\
Quality - low-quality food<br>\
<br>\
What are the advantages and disadvantages of students using technology in free time. <br>\
<b>Pros:</b><br>\
1. easy to find information (google)<br>\
2. learn English while using technology (duolingo/ games)<br>\
3. (facebook) connects with friends<br>\

		,vi:"Có ba lợi ích của việc ăn đồ ăn nhanh trong cuộc sống hàng ngày của chúng ta. Trước hết, ăn đồ ăn nhanh giúp tâm trạng của chúng ta tốt hơn. Có rất nhiều loại món ăn có sẵn, ngay cả trên vỉa hè. Do đó, mọi người có thể dễ dàng tìm thấy thức ăn trong những ngày làm việc bận rộn và hối hả. Bên cạnh đó, chúng ta luôn có thể thử những bữa ăn mới và có thể bạn sẽ không thấy chán vì có rất nhiều lựa chọn đồ ăn nhanh, đặc biệt là nếu bạn sống ở thành phố lớn. Thứ hai, ăn đồ ăn nhanh giúp chúng ta tránh lãng phí thực phẩm. Thường có thức ăn thừa khi bạn chuẩn bị bữa ăn ở nhà. Chúng có thể được để trong tủ lạnh với ý định tốt nhất, nhưng thức ăn thường bị lãng phí. Khi bạn gọi đồ ăn nhanh, bạn sẽ nhận được những gì bạn cần cho bữa ăn cụ thể đó, vì vậy không còn gì để lưu trữ trong tủ lạnh và không có gì bị lãng phí. Cuối cùng, đồ ăn nhanh cũng rất tiện lợi khi đi du lịch. Khi đi du lịch, bạn sẽ không có thời gian để chuẩn bị cho bữa ăn của mình, vì vậy bạn cũng có thể mua một ít đồ ăn nhanh. Bạn sẽ không chỉ bỏ qua việc nấu nướng mà còn thoát khỏi việc phải rửa bát đĩa sau đó. Do đó, khi đi du lịch, đồ ăn nhanh là một lựa chọn thay thế tuyệt vời cho việc nấu ăn vì bạn có thể dành thêm thời gian cho các chuyến đi và tìm hiểu về văn hóa địa phương.<br>\
Tuy nhiên, cũng có ba nhược điểm khi tiêu thụ đồ ăn nhanh. Thứ nhất, nó có nhiều thành phần không lành mạnh và thường thiếu các loại vitamin và khoáng chất thiết yếu. Mặc dù có một số loại thực phẩm bổ dưỡng, nhưng các món ăn phổ biến nhất tại các nhà hàng thức ăn nhanh thường khá có hại. Do đó, theo thời gian, mức độ thể lực cũng như chất lượng cuộc sống nói chung của bạn có thể giảm đáng kể. Thứ hai, nó chứa calo và khiến mọi người béo phì. Bên cạnh đó, đồ ăn nhanh không phải là lựa chọn thông minh để giảm cân vì nó chứa nhiều calo. Cuối cùng, có rất nhiều loại thực phẩm chất lượng thấp nhưng đắt tiền không rõ nguồn gốc. Vì vậy, việc nấu ăn vui vẻ cùng gia đình tại nhà vẫn có thể ít tốn kém và an toàn hơn.<br>\
Tóm lại, bạn nên tự nấu ăn vì nấu ăn đảm bảo bạn tiêu thụ thực phẩm bổ dưỡng, đốt cháy calo và tốn ít tiền hơn so với việc mua đồ ăn nhanh. Nếu bạn thực sự thích đồ ăn nhanh, đôi khi bạn nên mua để bảo vệ bản thân khỏi các thành phần không tốt và giảm cân.<br>\
<br>\
<b>Ưu điểm</b><br>\
Sức khỏe tinh thần - giúp tâm trạng của chúng ta tốt hơn <br>\
Du lịch - dễ mang theo khi đi du lịch<br>\
Thời gian - thời gian chờ rất ngắn<br>\
Hương vị - hương vị tuyệt vời/ngon<br>\
Cuộc sống xã hội - cung cấp không gian để tụ tập<br>\
<b>Nhược điểm</b><br>\
Cân nặng - có thể khiến mọi người béo phì<br>\
Sức khỏe thể chất - các thành phần chế biến quá mức có thể gây ra bệnh tim<br>\
Giá cả - không phải là thứ quá đắt để ăn hàng ngày<br>\
Nghiện - có thể bị nghiện khi ăn đồ ăn nhanh<br>\
Chất lượng - thực phẩm chất lượng thấp<br>\
<br>\
Ưu điểm và nhược điểm của việc học sinh sử dụng công nghệ trong thời gian rảnh rỗi là gì. <br>\
<b>Ưu điểm:</b><br>\
1. dễ tìm thông tin (google)<br>\
2. học tiếng Anh trong khi sử dụng công nghệ (duolingo/ trò chơi)<br>\
3. (facebook) kết nối với bạn bè<br>\
<b>Nhược điểm</b>:<br>\
1. Nguy cơ nghiện sử dụng công nghệ (chơi trò chơi) -> có thể gây trầm cảm<br>\
2. Giảm khả năng tập trung -> nghiên cứu -> tế bào thần kinh/ não ('TikTok kết nối lại não của chúng ta')<br>\
3. Ít cơ hội phát triển kỹ năng giao tiếp (cách nói chuyện và giao tiếp bằng mắt)/ quá nhiều thời gian sử dụng màn hình làm giảm tương tác trực tiếp<br>\
4. Có thể ảnh hưởng đến sức khỏe của mắt -> có thể gây cận thị (tầm nhìn ngắn)<br>\
5. Có thể góp phần vào lối sống ít vận động (lối sống không hoạt động) -> gây béo phì/thừa cân"

	,vi:"Mô tả một người nổi tiếng mà bạn muốn gặp.<br>\
Một người nổi tiếng mà tôi rất vinh dự được gặp là Taylor Swift. Swift là một nhạc sĩ được ca ngợi, người đã đạt được danh tiếng toàn cầu với nhiều bản hit trong 20 năm qua. Cô cũng được biết đến rộng rãi với khả năng sáng tác nhạc đặc biệt của mình.<br>\
Tôi bắt đầu nghe nhạc của Taylor Swift từ khi còn học trung học. Tôi đã là một người hâm mộ lớn của cô ấy kể từ đó. Tôi thấy giai điệu của cô ấy vô cùng hấp dẫn và luôn ngưỡng mộ kỹ năng viết lời của cô ấy. Ngoài ra, thông qua việc xem nhiều cuộc phỏng vấn và chương trình trò chuyện có sự góp mặt của Taylor, tôi đã trở nên ngưỡng mộ tính cách điềm tĩnh và điềm đạm của cô ấy, đó là lý do tại sao tôi rất muốn được tương tác trực tiếp với cô ấy.<br>\
Hơn nữa, Taylor Swift từ lâu đã là hình mẫu của tôi vì nhiều lý do. Cô ấy không chỉ là một nhạc sĩ tài năng mà còn là một người phụ nữ độc lập và bướng bỉnh, người làm việc chăm chỉ để đạt được mục tiêu của mình và đấu tranh cho những gì cô ấy tin tưởng. Cô ấy không bao giờ để phản ứng dữ dội và chỉ trích cản trở thành công của mình. Sẽ thật tuyệt nếu tôi có thể trò chuyện với cô ấy qua tách cà phê về cách cô ấy vượt qua những bất lợi trong sự nghiệp của mình. Tôi có thể học được nhiều điều từ đó."
