Sonia was very well dressed. She had on a jacket and a long, dark blue skirt. She was also wearing a yellow blouse. She wasn't carrying a bag, but she did have a small wallet with her. Oh, and I remember she had nice gold earrings. I also remember her shoes. She was wearing black shoes with very high heels.<br>\

Brian was very casually dressed. He was wearing some really old jeans—you know, the ones with holes in them—with a new wide leather belt and a white T-shirt. He had on some boots, high brown ones. They looked really nice. He also had a red scarf. He usually wears a couple of big rings, but he wasn't wearing any at the party. He was wearing an interesting silver watch, though.<br>\

Kevin was wearing a yellow shirt and a green tie. I didn't like the tie, but I liked the shirt. He also had on brown pants. He was wearing sneakers with long white socks—kind of cute, actually. And he had a leather bag over one shoulder.<br>\

Brian ăn mặc rất giản dị. Anh ấy mặc một chiếc quần jean rất cũ—bạn biết đấy, loại có lỗ thủng—với một chiếc thắt lưng da bản rộng mới và một chiếc áo phông trắng. Anh ấy đi một đôi bốt cao màu nâu. Chúng trông thực sự đẹp. Anh ấy cũng có một chiếc khăn quàng cổ màu đỏ. Anh ấy thường đeo một vài chiếc nhẫn lớn, nhưng anh ấy không đeo chiếc nào trong bữa tiệc. Tuy nhiên, anh ấy đeo một chiếc đồng hồ bạc khá thú vị.<br>\

Kevin mặc một chiếc áo sơ mi màu vàng và cà vạt màu xanh lá cây. Tôi không thích chiếc cà vạt, nhưng tôi thích chiếc áo sơ mi. Anh ấy cũng mặc quần nâu. Anh ấy đi giày thể thao với tất dài màu trắng—thực ra thì khá dễ thương. Và anh ấy đeo một chiếc túi da trên một vai.<br>\

Oh, yes! I love working with kids. They're so much fun.<br>\
Well, I guess you have the perfect job!<br>\
Yeah, I like it a lot. There's just one thing I don't like.<br>\
What's that?<br>\
The distance to school. It's too far away. It takes me an hour to drive there every day.<br>\
Wow. That must be awful!<br>\
It is, but the schools that are near me are not as good.<br>\
3<br>\
How is your new job going, Anna?<br>\
Good, thanks. I really like it.<br>\
What do you like best about it?<br>\
I think it's the people I work with. They are so nice.<br>\
People make all the difference in a job, don't they?<br>\
They sure do. The only trouble is, I have to travel a lot. I'm away from home for about two weeks every month.<br>\
Yeah, that can be difficult.<br>\
It is. I hope I won't have to travel so much next year.<br>\

Do you enjoy being a salesperson, Nancy?<br>\
Yes, I do like it. I get to meet so many people.<br>\
Is it hard work?<br>\
Yes, it can be. I don't like the long hours. I'm always really tired when I get home at night.<br>\
That's too bad. Why don't you quit?<br>\
Because I think my boss is great to work for.<br>\
5<br>\
How long have you been working in a restaurant, Martin?<br>\
For more than five years.<br>\
Wow. You must really enjoy it.<br>\
Oh no, I don't enjoy it at all! It's hard work and pretty tiring, too. I'm on my feet all night.<br>\

I think exercise is so important to good health. There is a really good sports club near my school. During the week, I play tennis there for an hour before school starts. On weekends, I usually work out at the gym near my house for a few hours. I also play baseball with some friends from school. It's so much fun!<br>\
2<br>\
I don't like jogging or doing anything too energetic. I prefer taking walks. I like to take a short walk every day through the park across from my house. Sometimes my boyfriend goes with me. It's nice to talk and look at the flowers and trees. On Sunday, I like to swim, but for only about a half hour. I sleep the rest of the weekend.<br>\
3<br>\
I am a big football fan, but I only watch it on TV. I can't stand playing it! There are great games to watch on the weekend. I also enjoy watching tennis. I'd like to learn someday, but I don't like to sweat. I love chess and often play with my younger sister. She's really good at it and usually wins. On the weekends, I love to play video games with some of my friends.<br>\
4<br>\
I just love to exercise! I like many different sports. Let's see... I like swimming a lot. I get up very early, around 5 a.m., and swim for two hours from Monday to Friday. I also enjoy basketball and play with a group of friends from work every Tuesday night. And I've also started playing golf this year. Before playing, I go jogging to warm up.<br>\
5<br>\
I enjoy exercise, but I don't do it as much as I should. I meet a friend every Wednesday and we play tennis. I'm not a very good player, but it's fun and we usually play for an hour. On weekends, I like to bicycle in our neighborhood. I guess I spend an hour or two doing that. Oh, and I love baseball, but only watching it while sitting on the couch eating popcorn!"

Tôi nghĩ tập thể dục rất quan trọng đối với sức khỏe. Có một câu lạc bộ thể thao thực sự tốt gần trường tôi. Trong tuần, tôi chơi quần vợt ở đó một giờ trước khi vào học. Vào cuối tuần, tôi thường tập thể dục tại phòng tập thể dục gần nhà trong vài giờ. Tôi cũng chơi bóng chày với một số người bạn ở trường. Thật vui!<br>\
2<br>\
Tôi không thích chạy bộ hoặc làm bất cứ điều gì quá năng động. Tôi thích đi bộ. Tôi thích đi bộ một đoạn ngắn mỗi ngày qua công viên đối diện nhà tôi. Đôi khi bạn trai tôi đi cùng tôi. Thật tuyệt khi được nói chuyện và ngắm hoa và cây cối. Vào Chủ Nhật, tôi thích bơi, nhưng chỉ trong khoảng nửa giờ. Tôi ngủ suốt phần còn lại của cuối tuần.<br>\

Tôi là một người hâm mộ bóng đá lớn, nhưng tôi chỉ xem bóng đá trên TV. Tôi không thể chịu được việc chơi bóng đá! Có những trận đấu tuyệt vời để xem vào cuối tuần. Tôi cũng thích xem quần vợt. Tôi muốn học một ngày nào đó, nhưng tôi không thích đổ mồ hôi. Tôi thích cờ vua và thường chơi với em gái mình. Em ấy chơi rất giỏi và thường thắng. Vào cuối tuần, tôi thích chơi trò chơi điện tử với một số người bạn của mình.<br>\

Tôi chỉ thích tập thể dục! Tôi thích nhiều môn thể thao khác nhau. Hãy xem nào... Tôi rất thích bơi lội. Tôi dậy rất sớm, khoảng 5 giờ sáng, và bơi trong hai giờ từ thứ Hai đến thứ Sáu. Tôi cũng thích bóng rổ và chơi với một nhóm bạn từ nơi làm việc vào mỗi tối thứ Ba. Và tôi cũng bắt đầu chơi golf trong năm nay. Trước khi chơi, tôi chạy bộ để khởi động.<br>\
5<br>\
Tôi thích tập thể dục, nhưng tôi không tập nhiều như tôi nên làm. Tôi gặp một người bạn vào mỗi thứ Tư và chúng tôi chơi quần vợt. Tôi không phải là một người chơi giỏi, nhưng nó rất vui và chúng tôi thường chơi trong một giờ. Vào cuối tuần, tôi thích đạp xe quanh khu phố của mình. Tôi đoán tôi dành một hoặc hai giờ để làm điều đó. À, và tôi thích bóng chày, nhưng chỉ xem nó trong khi ngồi trên ghế dài ăn bỏng ngô!"

I love traveling. My mother and I go to a different place every year. Both of us love to learn new things about cultures. My father never goes with us because he hates flying. My older sister is in college, so she stays home and studies while we're away. Sometimes I wish my sister and my father would travel with us because I miss them."

Cả bố và mẹ tôi đều cao hơn tôi. Bố tôi khá cao, nhưng anh trai tôi thậm chí còn cao hơn bố tôi. Họ trông giống như một đội bóng rổ vậy! Chị gái tôi và tôi là những người thấp bé nhất trong gia đình.<br>\

Anh trai tôi không hề hứng thú với âm nhạc. Anh ấy thích ô tô, giống như bố tôi. Nhưng tôi không hứng thú với ô tô. Tôi chơi guitar và piano. Tôi đoán tôi thích âm nhạc vì mẹ tôi. Bà ấy hát rất hay. Bà ấy chơi piano cũng rất giỏi.<br>\

Tôi thích động vật. Tôi có một con chó và tôi nuôi một vài con vẹt trong một cái lồng lớn trong phòng. Tôi thích chụp ảnh những chú chim hoang dã khi ở vùng nông thôn. Bố tôi và tôi thường đi chơi xa vào cuối tuần và chúng tôi có khoảng thời gian tuyệt vời khi ngắm chim. Chị gái tôi nghĩ tôi bị điên. Khi chị gái tôi có thời gian rảnh, chị ấy thích chơi bài. Tôi không thích chơi bài.<br>\

Tôi thích đọc sách. Tôi đọc rất nhiều sách và tôi thích đến thư viện. Bố tôi thích những thứ ngoài trời. Ông ấy thực sự thích thể thao và bơi lội, và ông ấy luôn bảo tôi nên quan tâm đến thể thao hơn. Nhưng mẹ tôi nói rằng đọc sách là cách học tốt nhất. Bà ấy luôn đưa cho tôi những cuốn sách mà bà ấy đã đọc.<br>\

Tôi rất thích máy tính. Tôi luôn tự học các chương trình máy tính mới và tôi có rất nhiều phần mềm tuyệt vời. Anh trai tôi và tôi dành toàn bộ thời gian rảnh rỗi của mình ở các cửa hàng máy tính và trên Internet. Chị gái tôi quan tâm đến nghệ thuật hơn. Chị ấy thích âm nhạc và thích đọc sách. Chị ấy ghét máy tính!<br>\
6.<br>\
Tôi thích đi du lịch. Mẹ tôi và tôi đến một nơi khác nhau mỗi năm. Cả hai chúng tôi đều thích tìm hiểu những điều mới mẻ về các nền văn hóa. Bố tôi không bao giờ đi cùng chúng tôi vì ông ấy ghét bay. Chị gái tôi đang học đại học, vì vậy chị ấy ở nhà và học khi chúng tôi đi xa. Đôi khi tôi muốn chị gái và bố tôi đi du lịch cùng chúng tôi vì tôi nhớ họ."

I could never buy a car at home because we pay a very high tax on cars. Only rich people can really afford to buy a car at home. Here in the US, I drive a nice new car and I can easily afford it. You don’t have to be rich to own a car, which is great.<br>\
2.<br>\
At home it only costs about $200 a month to rent a nice apartment. That’s what I used to pay for a four-room apartment in a good neighborhood. Here in the US, I pay about twice that for a much smaller apartment, and it’s not in a very nice neighborhood.<br>\
3.<br>\
I bought a lot of clothes in my country before I moved to the US because everyone told me how expensive American clothing is. I was kind of surprised that I could get nice clothes here for very reasonable prices. In fact, it costs me less for clothes here than it used to cost me at home.<br>\
4.<br>\
I come from a small country and not a lot of people travel by plane because it costs more than most people can afford. But the US is such a big country and the population is large, so you have a lot of people traveling by plane. That’s what keeps the prices down. That means I can afford to fly here and I do it all the time. I couldn’t do that at home.<br>\
5.<br>\
Most people send their children to private schools at home because the public schools are not very good. You have to pay a lot to do that, so it’s a big expense for many people. Public schools are better here, and cheaper than in my country. People don’t have to spend a lot on tuition, so most people send their children to public schools. <br>\
6.<br>\
Here in the US you need to have health insurance because it costs a lot to see a doctor or to enter a hospital. At home, you don’t have to pay much to see a doctor or go to a hospital because most of the clinics and hospitals are run by the government."

Tôi không bao giờ có thể mua ô tô ở nhà vì chúng tôi phải trả thuế ô tô rất cao. Chỉ những người giàu mới có thể thực sự đủ khả năng mua ô tô ở nhà. Ở Hoa Kỳ, tôi lái một chiếc ô tô mới đẹp và tôi có thể dễ dàng mua được. Bạn không cần phải giàu có để sở hữu một chiếc ô tô, điều đó thật tuyệt.<br>\

Ở nhà, chỉ mất khoảng 200 đô la một tháng để thuê một căn hộ đẹp. Đó là số tiền tôi từng trả cho một căn hộ bốn phòng ở một khu phố tốt. Ở Hoa Kỳ, tôi phải trả gấp đôi số tiền đó cho một căn hộ nhỏ hơn nhiều và nó không ở một khu phố đẹp.<br>\
3.<br>\
Tôi đã mua rất nhiều quần áo ở đất nước của mình trước khi chuyển đến Hoa Kỳ vì mọi người đều nói với tôi rằng quần áo của Mỹ đắt như thế nào. Tôi hơi ngạc nhiên khi tôi có thể mua được quần áo đẹp ở đây với giá rất phải chăng. Trên thực tế, tôi mua quần áo ở đây ít tốn kém hơn so với ở nhà.<br>\

Tôi đến từ một quốc gia nhỏ và không nhiều người đi máy bay vì chi phí cao hơn khả năng chi trả của hầu hết mọi người. Nhưng Hoa Kỳ là một quốc gia lớn và dân số đông, vì vậy có rất nhiều người đi máy bay. Đó là lý do khiến giá cả ở đây thấp. Điều đó có nghĩa là tôi có đủ khả năng chi trả để bay đến đây và tôi làm điều đó mọi lúc. Tôi không thể làm như vậy ở nhà.<br>\

Hầu hết mọi người gửi con đến trường tư ở nhà vì trường công không tốt lắm. Bạn phải trả nhiều tiền để làm như vậy, vì vậy đây là khoản chi lớn đối với nhiều người.

I went to a new steak restaurant last night that opened near my house. I love trying new places. To start the meal, I had an interesting appetizer. It was some kind of seafood with a spicy sauce on it… Mmm! The main dish, of course, was steak. It was very small and a little tough, though.<br>\
However, the vegetables were great—nice and fresh, but not too oily. The final thing was the best—the dessert! It was apple pie with a lot of ice cream on it. I know that I shouldn't eat so many sweets, but it was delicious!<br>\

Have you ever tried that seafood restaurant on Main Street? You should—it's great! I go there often. In fact, I went there last weekend. To begin, I had a salad. It was nice and fresh with a great house dressing. My main dish was a fish that I had never tried. I really enjoyed the spices it was cooked in. The vegetables were good—very fresh and tasty. For dessert, I had chocolate cake. It's usually very delicious, but this time, it was much too sweet. I couldn't eat more than two bites! That's okay, though, because I am on a diet.<br>\

My new girlfriend took me to a Chinese restaurant in her neighborhood the other night. It was pretty good. First we had some egg rolls. They were the best I had ever tasted. Then we ordered the beef and pepper stir-fry. It came in a very interesting sauce—spicy, but not too spicy. We also ordered the steamed vegetables, but they were awful. They were really too soft. The dessert was a big bowl of fresh fruit. Some of the fruit I had never seen. It was fantastic—and so was my date!<br>\

For lunch, my co-worker and I went to a nice little French restaurant near our office. He didn't feel like eating much, so he just had a small salad. I had a large meal, though. First, I had the onion soup, but it was much too salty. For my main dish, I had a piece of pork. It was too dry and had no taste. The vegetables were perfect, though—broccoli and peas. Those are my favorites.<br>\
Finally, I had a large bowl of chocolate mousse. It was just like the chocolate mousse I had in France during my last vacation—very creamy and delicious. I think I'll have it next time, too."

Tôi đã đến một nhà hàng bít tết mới mở gần nhà tôi tối qua. Tôi thích thử những nơi mới. Để bắt đầu bữa ăn, tôi đã có một món khai vị thú vị. Đó là một loại hải sản với nước sốt cay… Mmm! Món chính, tất nhiên, là bít tết. Nó rất nhỏ và hơi dai.<br>\
Tuy nhiên, rau thì tuyệt vời—ngon và tươi, nhưng không quá nhiều dầu mỡ. Món cuối cùng là tuyệt nhất—món tráng miệng! Đó là bánh táo với rất nhiều kem trên đó. Tôi biết rằng tôi không nên ăn nhiều đồ ngọt như vậy, nhưng nó rất ngon!<br>\
2<br>\
Bạn đã bao giờ thử nhà hàng hải sản trên Phố Chính chưa? Bạn nên thử—nó tuyệt lắm! Tôi thường đến đó. Thực tế là tôi đã đến đó vào cuối tuần trước. Để bắt đầu, tôi đã ăn một đĩa salad. Nó ngon và tươi với nước sốt đặc biệt của nhà hàng. Món chính của tôi là một loại cá mà tôi chưa bao giờ thử. Tôi thực sự thích các loại gia vị được sử dụng để nấu nó. Các loại rau thì ngon—rất tươi và ngon. Đối với món tráng miệng, tôi đã ăn bánh sô cô la. Thường thì rất ngon, nhưng lần này thì quá ngọt. Tôi không thể ăn quá hai miếng! Nhưng không sao, vì tôi đang ăn kiêng.<br>\

Bạn gái mới của tôi đã đưa tôi đến một nhà hàng Trung Quốc ở khu phố của cô ấy vào đêm hôm trước. Nhà hàng khá ngon. Đầu tiên chúng tôi ăn một ít chả giò. Đó là món ngon nhất mà tôi từng nếm. Sau đó, chúng tôi gọi món thịt bò xào tiêu. Nó được phục vụ trong một loại nước sốt rất thú vị—cay, nhưng không quá cay. Chúng tôi cũng gọi món rau hấp, nhưng chúng rất tệ. Chúng thực sự quá mềm. Món tráng miệng là một bát lớn trái cây tươi. Một số loại trái cây mà tôi chưa từng thấy. Thật tuyệt vời—và bạn hẹn hò của tôi cũng vậy!<br>\
4 <br>\
Vào bữa trưa, đồng nghiệp của tôi và tôi đã đến một nhà hàng Pháp nhỏ xinh gần văn phòng của chúng tôi. Anh ấy không muốn ăn nhiều, vì vậy anh ấy chỉ ăn một ít salad. Tuy nhiên, tôi đã ăn một bữa ăn lớn. Đầu tiên, tôi gọi súp hành tây, nhưng nó quá mặn. Đối với món chính, tôi gọi một miếng thịt lợn. Nó quá khô và không có mùi vị gì. Tuy nhiên, rau thì hoàn hảo—bông cải xanh và đậu Hà Lan. Đó là những món tôi thích nhất.<br>\
Cuối cùng, tôi gọi một bát lớn sô cô la mousse. Nó giống hệt như sô cô la mousse tôi đã ăn ở Pháp trong kỳ nghỉ trước—rất béo và ngon. Tôi nghĩ mình cũng sẽ ăn nó vào lần tới."

Cô ấy đã bị khoảng một tuần.<br>\
Đôi khi phải mất một thời gian dài để vượt qua cơn cúm. Terry đã bị ốm một vài lần<br>\

Tôi biết. Thật tệ.<br>\

Anh chàng kia vừa chuyển đến đây từ Canada. Tôi đã nói chuyện với anh ấy một thời gian trước.<br>\
Anh ấy thực sự thú vị. Anh ấy là một diễn viên và đã xuất hiện trong một vài bộ phim.<br>\
Ừ, anh ấy đã kể với tôi như vậy. Anh ấy có nhắc đến tên những bộ phim của mình, nhưng tôi chưa xem<br>\
bất kỳ bộ phim nào.<br>\
Có lẽ một ngày nào đó anh ấy sẽ trở thành một ngôi sao lớn.<br>\
6<br>\
Có một cuộc triển lãm thực sự thú vị tại bảo tàng vào tháng này. Tất cả đều là về Walt<br>\
Disney và câu chuyện về cách ông bắt đầu làm phim hoạt hình.<br>\
Đúng không? Tôi đã không đến bảo tàng trong một thời gian dài.<br>\
Bạn nên đến đó và xem thử. Tôi chắc rằng bạn sẽ thấy nó thực sự thú vị.<br>\
Tôi nghĩ là tôi sẽ thấy vậy. Cảm ơn bạn đã cho tôi biết."

The bookshelf looks really good in the living room. And the TV is just fine. When I find a stereo, I'm going to put it in the bookshelf. I don't have a stereo now because I want to find a cheap one.

If you have an old bookshelf you aren't using, I'd be really happy to buy it! I haven't been able to find one that is the right size. All the ones I looked at were too big.

I was thinking about getting a bookshelf, but I don't have many books yet, so I guess I can wait. I was lucky. I got a really cheap used TV the other day. It only cost $50 and it works really well.

It's one of the funniest movies I've seen. It's about this weird family that goes on a European vacation. But it's a vacation where everything goes wrong. First, they lose all their luggage, then they end up in the wrong city by mistake. After that, someone thinks they are bank robbers and there's this crazy car chase. If you want a good laugh, you should see it.<br>\
Yeah, I've had a busy week. It sounds like the kind of movie I need to see.<br>\

Oh, it's one of those movies that's full of car chases and fights and people jumping out of airplanes and stuff. The special effects are pretty good, and it's really exciting, especially when these two guys fight it out standing on the roof of a 50-story building. Of course, the bad guy falls off the roof in the end.<br>\
Sounds good. I like those kinds of movies.<br>\

Yuck. I hate those kinds of movies. I don't think I'll bother seeing it. Thanks, anyway.<br>\

Đây là một trong những bộ phim hài hước nhất mà tôi từng xem. Phim kể về một gia đình kỳ lạ đi nghỉ ở châu Âu. Nhưng đó là một kỳ nghỉ mà mọi thứ đều trở nên tồi tệ. Đầu tiên, họ làm mất hết hành lý, sau đó họ vô tình đến nhầm thành phố. Sau đó, có người nghĩ họ là cướp ngân hàng và có một cảnh rượt đuổi bằng ô tô điên rồ. Nếu bạn muốn cười thoải mái, bạn nên xem phim này.<br>\

Đúng vậy. Điều duy nhất tôi không thích là nhạc phim. Họ có nhạc rất to và sôi động trong suốt bộ phim. Thật khó chịu.<br>\

Bộ phim như thế nào?<br>\
Ờ, nó được cho là một câu chuyện phiêu lưu. Một số nhà thám hiểm ở Châu Phi đã phát hiện ra loài động vật mới này. Một con vượn thực sự to lớn mà họ muốn mang về Mỹ.<br>\
Nghe có vẻ thú vị.<br>\
Đúng vậy, cốt truyện thì hay, nhưng hiệu ứng đặc biệt thì tệ. Con vượn trông không thực tế chút nào. Nó trông giống như một món đồ chơi hay gì đó. Và hai diễn viên chính thì khá tệ.<br>\
Vậy thì không đáng xem sao?<br>\
Không. Nhưng hãy mua nhạc phim. Nhạc phim tuyệt vời.<br>\

Ừ, tuyệt lắm.<br>\

Bob, bạn nghĩ sao?<br>\
Rất đẹp. Nhưng giá bao nhiêu?<br>\
Chỉ có 399 đô la thôi.<br>\
399 đô la! Bạn đùa à!<br>\
3<br>\
Ồ, tôi chưa đọc cái này. Có tốt không?<br>\
Tôi nghĩ vậy.<br>\
Có phải là một bí ẩn không?<br>\
Ồ, thực ra tôi chưa đọc, nhưng tôi nghĩ vậy.<br>\
Đúng là thứ tôi cần. Tôi sẽ lấy nó.<br>\
4<br>\
Những thứ này có tươi không?<br>\
Vâng, chúng tươi.<br>\
Chúng trông ngon quá.<br>\
Sao bạn không thử một cái?<br>\
Thật sao? Được thôi. Ừm. Những thứ này ngon.<br>\
5<br>\
Tôi nghĩ chúng ổn. Chúng sẽ tuyệt vời khi đi biển. Bạn nghĩ sao?<br>\
Được, nhưng bạn không thấy chúng hơi nhỏ sao?<br>\
6<br>\
Tôi có thể chơi bản này không? Tôi muốn nghe trước khi mua.<br>\
Được, để tôi chơi cho bạn nghe. Tôi nghĩ bạn sẽ thích."

Could I help you with anything today, ma'am?<br>\
Well, I really like this blouse. Do you have it in another design?<br>\
Yes, we do.<br>\
Great! I'll take it, then.<br>\

Do you need any help, sir?<br>\
Yes, actually, I do. These are a small and they're too tight. Do you have a medium?<br>\
Yes.<br>\
Great! I'll take them.<br>\

These are the most beautiful watches in the store.<br>\
They really are nice. How much is this one?<br>\
It's $2,500. Would you like to buy it?<br>\
No, thanks. It's too expensive for me<br>\

Need any help this morning?<br>\
No, I'm just looking around for some gift ideas, thanks.<br>\

Yes, they certainly are. I love the design. Do you have one in a size 12?<br>\
Yes, we do. Would you like to take it?<br>\
Yes, please.<br>\
6<br>\
Do you need any help?<br>\
Yes. I want to buy a shirt for my husband. Do you have anything in cotton?<br>\
Yes, we do. Look at these.<br>\
They're perfect! I'll buy the gray one.<br>\
7<br>\
Good afternoon, ma'am. Can I help you find anything?<br>\
Oh, I'm not sure what I want. I'll just look around for a while, thanks.<br>\
8<br>\
May I help you with anything, or are you just looking?<br>\
I'd like these green gym shorts, please. Do you have them in a large?<br>\

This one?<br>\
No, not the one with the short sleeves. The other one.<br>\
Here you are.<br>\
Thanks. Can this be machine-washed, by the way?<br>\
No, it's silk, so you should dry-clean it. It's not a good idea to wash it by hand or machine-wash it.<br>\

I'd like to buy some envelopes.<br>\
Which ones? These big ones?<br>\

Yes, they look like a better size. Can they be used for air mail letters?<br>\
No. These are meant for regular mail.<br>\

The one with the narrow band?<br>\
No. The one with the wide band. Is this a man's watch? I'm looking for a gift for my girlfriend.<br>\
Actually, anyone can wear it. It's not just for a man.<br>\
Hmm. It's nice.<br>\

I don't think they are very sweet. The smaller ones are usually sweeter.<br>\
Okay. Let's get some of these small ones."

Tôi có thể thử chiếc áo đó được không?<br>\

Không, không phải cái tay ngắn đâu. Cái kia.<br>\

Không, nó là lụa, vì vậy bạn nên giặt khô. Không nên giặt bằng tay hoặc giặt máy.<br>\

Tôi muốn mua một số phong bì.<br>\
Cái nào? Những cái to này à?<br>\
Không, chúng quá to. Bạn có cái nào nhỏ hơn không?<br>\

Vâng, chúng có vẻ là cỡ lớn hơn. Chúng có thể dùng để gửi thư bằng đường hàng không không?<br>\
Không. Chúng dùng để gửi thư thường.<br>\

 I wear it instead of sunglasses because sunglasses make me look so stupid. I always wear it when it's sunny outside. If I don't wear it, the sun hurts my eyes. It's not too good on windy days, though.<br>\
 2<br>\
 It's excellent for work because it's pretty big and I can get all my business papers in it. It's not one of those cheap-looking plastic ones. It's made of real leather.<br>\
 3<br>\
 I use it to put my things in when I play sports. It's pretty big, so I can get all my clothes and my running shoes into it.<br>\
 4<br>\
 It's an expensive one, but I use it a lot because it's very wet here in the fall. I love the colors, too. People can easily find me in a crowd when I'm using it.<br>\
 5<br>\
 It's great when you're on a trip somewhere, especially when you're taking a flight, because you can take it on board the aircraft. It's not so big, so you can put it in the overhead compartment or under the seat in front of you. It's also got wheels and a handle that you can pull out.<br>\
 6<br>\
They're very comfortable for jogging or walking. That's good because I jog and walk a lot. But they're really old. I've had them for about three years. I hate the color. But I'll use them until I can afford a new pair."

 It's a brown leather one. I keep all my money and my credit cards in it. I usually keep it in my back pocket. It probably fell out when I was getting off the bus. I hope I get it back because it also has my ID card in it, and that's very important.<br>\
 2.<br>\
 I'm always losing them or putting them down and forgetting where I put them. I think I was wearing them when I was on the bus. Then I stopped for a cup of coffee at a coffee shop. I think I took them off then because I don't need them when I read, and I was reading a magazine. Yes, maybe that's where they are. <br>\
 3.<br>\
 I'm sure I had them when I left school because I remember putting them in my purse. I'm sure I had them when I came home or I couldn't have driven the car or opened the front door. So that means they're somewhere inside the house.<br>\
 4.<br>\
 I'm sure I used it to pay the bill at the restaurant when I had lunch there. After that I went to the department store, and I think I used it when I bought my jacket. I'm sure that's the last time I used it, so it's probably there.<br>\
  5.<br>\
 I usually keep it at home in a drawer in my desk because I only use it when I travel abroad. But it's not there, so I wonder where I put it. Oh, maybe I left it at the office when I came back from my trip to France. I think that's where it is, because I went straight from the airport to my office. <br>\
 6.<br>\
 I thought it was in my briefcase. I usually put it there when I get one from the newsstand and then read it when I get home. Now I remember! I was on the subway! I took it out to read the sports section. I'm sure I left it there."
