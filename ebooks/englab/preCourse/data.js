1. Do you live in a house or an apartment?<br>\
I live in a two-storey terraced house with my family which is located in the city centre./ on the outskirts of the city (vùng ngoại ô tpho).<br>\
<br>\
2. What do you like about living there?<br>\
I like that most of the rooms face south, which means we get a lot of natural light. And the location is very convenient as all the facilities and services are within walking distance, which means I can easily grab anything I need in just a few minutes.<br>\
<br>\
3. What is your favorite room?<br>\
I would say that it’s the living room because it’s the most spacious room in the house, with a comfy sofa and a big, round table where we eat dinner every night. That’s the room where the whole family gathers together and shares ups and downs in our lives.<br>\

Last year, on the occasion of my 16th birthday, my mother gave me a very precious gift, which is an iPhone 6s. I have used it both in study and entertainment every day.<br>\
My smartphone is considered as one of my modern educational tools. Only with the phone connected to the Internet, I can access and surf webs to broaden my knowledge. For example, when there are lessons that I don’t understand in class, I can use it to search for lectures and videos online, which is really helpful.<br>\
Moreover, I can download a lot of games or books, music, movies and they are free. As a result, after tiring lessons, this will be a good way to relieve stress and get back my energy. For instance, when I do the housework with my mother, I regularly listen to my favorite songs. In addition, it helps me to keep in touch with my family and my friends. When I want to make contact with my classmates, I can text messages or make video calls and we can easily see each other’s faces.<br>\
In short, my phone has offered me a range of great benefits in my daily life. If I didn’t have it, it would be difficult for me to contact my near and dear friends and family members.<br>\
